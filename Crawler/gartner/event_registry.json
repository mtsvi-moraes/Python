                "title": "Start A Business, Get An MSc - The University That Wants To Be An Incubator",
                "body": "I've been talking to Falmouth University Vice Chancellor, Professor Anne Carlisle for around half an hour when she casually mentions an objective that is genuinely startling. \"The whole university will be an incubator by 2030,\" she says.\n\nNow, there's nothing unusual about United Kingdom universities playing host to incubators and accelerators but they tend to represent just a small subset of campus activity. An ambition to create an incubator model that will encompass an entire institution - well, that's something new.\n\nBut Falmouth University - located in Cornwall, one of England's most economically deprived counties - is on something of a mission to do more than simply turn out cohort after cohort of well-qualified students. The aim is to play an active role in reviving the local economy and business creation is an important part of that plan.\n\n\"The university has a role to play in encouraging recovery in a low wage economy,\" says Professor Carlisle. \"We can play a part in creating a tech cluster, creating jobs and bringing prosperity to the region.\"\n\nAn Added Incentive\n\nAnd one of the key initiatives to achieve that aim has been the creation of Launchpad, a largely tech-focused incubator that combines all the elements you would expect in a business development program, with the added incentive of an academic qualification - an MSc, to be precise - for those taking part in each cohort.\n\nAs Professor Carlisle explains, Launchpad has been specifically designed to create, develop and launch businesses that meet clearly defined market needs, with alumni committing to remaining in Cornwall for at least five years after completing the program. It's hoped that a practical and market-led approach to creating new companies will not only deliver success to the entrepreneurial teams but also create much-needed high-paid jobs in the area.\n\nIn some respects, Falmouth University's Launchpad reflects a model developed in the U.K. by Entrepreneur First, in that teams are brought together without necessarily having business-creation ideas of their own.\n\nInstead, real-world challenges are set by industry partners such as interactive live-streaming service, Twitch, Sony, Green Man Gaming and the National Health Service. \"The teams are put together to solve those challenges,\" says Professor Carlisle.\n\nNow it has to be said that Falmouth is not a specialist technology institution. In fact, it started out as a School of Art and today its focus is on the arts and creative industries. So how does an tech incubator fit into that legacy?\n\nWell, Launchpad was set up to attract post-graduate students with an interest in business creation and as Professor Carlisle explains, it attracts well-qualified people from all over the country. Some have a background in tech. Others may be more interested in management or sales.\n\nAdded to that is the fact that from gaming to film production, the creative industries are themselves technology hungry and business savvy. This is reflected within the university. So, while you can certainly study acting or comedy scriptwriting at Falmouth, you can also - for example - learn to code, study Artificial Intelligence for Games, or take a management degree.\n\nGetting Creative\n\nThe creative side of the equation is important. Professor Carlisle sees the incubator as having particular strengths in areas such as the commercial exploitation of immersive technology. She also stresses the importance of deploying creativity in service of a broad range of businesses concepts. \"It's what we call the creative bridge,\" she says.\n\nThe creation of new businesses within the incubator involves a number of stages. Initially, the market is identified and validated. Talent is recruited to take the businesses forward. At some stage, cohort members are likely to learn about pivoting. Finally, if all goes well, businesses are incorporated. To date, 38 companies have been incorporated.\n\nThe companies emerging from incubator thus far cover a fairly wide range of products and sectors. To take a few examples, Constructiv has developed an app to aid the recruitment of construction workers; Data Duopoloy has developed tools to identify and ease congestion at visitor attractions; and Meatfreed is a community for people seeking alternative sources of protein.\n\nFunding\n\nBut will funding be available. For those unfamiliar with the geography of the UK, Cornwall sits on the South Western Edge of Britain at the end of a peninsula jutting out into the Atlantic. It is a long way from London and its growing community of VCs. It's also some distance from the increasingly important tech cluster surrounding Bristol and Bath. So where does the investment come from, given that VCs can be quite narrow in their geographical focus?\n\nTo some extent, that's where the partners come in. \"We would hope that a lot of the investment would come from the industry partners, says Professor Carlisle. She cites Codices. The company develops interactivity tools for online broadcasters and was invested in by Twitch.\n\nThe common theme at Falmouth's launchpad is a combination of creativity, business acumen and technology, all of which arguably sits fairly easily with the university's origins and current focus. It will be interesting to see how far and how fast the institution moves towards embedding the incubator model across a wider range of courses.",

                "title": "Report: 76% of manufacturers plan to adopt private 5G by 2024",
                "body": "The potential for 5G to completely transform industries is immeasurable. By promising decreased latency, enhanced security, and the ability to support artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR), sectors like health care, gaming, and emergency services will be forever altered. But those opportunities are still far in the future. Most industries and the majority of enterprises aren't yet equipped with the right infrastructure to support 5G. The major exception is manufacturing. As an industry almost entirely dependent on the successful connections between machines, manufacturing is ripe to adopt 5G. But that's only true if their IT teams are equipped with the right knowledge, skills, tools, and the ecosystem of service providers and technology vendors that can provide the tools and support to make individual visions of Industry 4.0 a reality.\n\nTo understand manufacturing teams' readiness for 5G, Accedian, a provider of performance analytics, cybersecurity threat detection, and end-user experience solutions, partnered with Analysys Mason on a new study of 5G adoption trends. The result was overwhelmingly positive: More than three-fourths (76%) of respondents are planning to adopt private 5G networks by 2024, and list the benefits of increased network security (63%), network performance (49%), and application performance (45%) as a few of the key reasons why.\n\nBut respondents also pointed out a few challenges that have impeded their adoption process thus far, such as the increased complexity of managing the network (43%). This is where service providers have a part to play, particularly in moving from being solely a vendor to becoming more of a strategic partner throughout the 5G adoption process. It's with this collaborative mindset that the promise of 5G in manufacturing will become a reality, and usher in Industry 4.0.\n\nAnalysys Mason, a management consultancy focused on technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT), surveyed 200 respondents from Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States across six verticals to gain insight into private 5G adoption.",

                "title": "AI Weekly: AI model training costs on the rise, highlighting need for new solutions",
                "body": "This week, Microsoft and Nvidia announced that they trained what they claim is one of the largest and most capable AI language models to date: Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation (MT-NLP). MT-NLP contains 530 billion parameters -- the parts of the model learned from historical data -- and achieves leading accuracy in a broad set of tasks, including reading comprehension and natural language inferences.\n\nBut building it didn't come cheap. Training took place across 560 Nvidia DGX A100 servers, each containing 8 Nvidia A100 80GB GPUs. Experts peg the cost in the millions of dollars.\n\nLike other large AI systems, MT-NLP raises questions about the accessibility of cutting-edge research approaches in machine learning. AI training costs dropped 100-fold between 2017 and 2019, but the totals still exceed the compute budgets of most startups, governments, nonprofits, and colleges. The inequity favors corporations and world superpowers with extraordinary access to resources at the expense of smaller players, cementing incumbent advantages.\n\nFor example, in early October, researchers at Alibaba detailed M6-10T, a language model containing 10 trillion parameters (roughly 57 times the size of OpenAI's GPT-3) trained across 512 Nvidia V100 GPUs for 10 days. The cheapest V100 plan available through Google Cloud Platform costs $2.28 per hour, which would equate to over $300,000 ($2.28 per hour multiplied by 24 hours over 10 days) -- further than most research teams can stretch.\n\nGoogle subsidiary DeepMind is estimated to have spent $35 million training a system to learn the Chinese board game Go. And when the company's researchers designed a model to play StarCraft II, they purposefully didn't try multiple ways of architecting a key component because the training cost would have been too high. Similarly, OpenAI didn't fix a mistake when it implemented GPT-3 because the cost of training made retraining the model infeasible.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that training costs can be inflated by factors other than an algorithm's technical aspects. As Yoav Shoham, Stanford University professor emeritus and cofounder of AI startup AI21 Labs, recently told Synced, personal and organizational considerations often contribute to a model's final price tag.\n\n\"[A] researcher might be impatient to wait three weeks to do a thorough analysis and their organization may not be able or wish to pay for it,\" he said. \"So for the same task, one could spend $100,000 or $1 million.\"\n\nStill, the increasing cost of training -- and storing -- algorithms like Huawei's PanGu-Alpha, Naver's HyperCLOVA, and the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence's Wu Dao 2.0 is giving rise to a cottage industry of startups aiming to \"optimize\" models without degrading accuracy. This week, former Intel exec Naveen Rao launched a new company, Mosaic ML, to offer tools, services, and training methods that improve AI system accuracy while lowering costs and saving time. Mosaic ML -- which has raised $37 million in venture capital -- competes with Codeplay Software, OctoML, Neural Magic, Deci, CoCoPie, and NeuReality in a market that's expected to grow exponentially in the coming years.\n\nIn a sliver of good news, the cost of basic machine learning operations has been falling over the past few years. A 2020 OpenAI survey found that since 2012, the amount of compute needed to train a model to the same performance on classifying images in a popular benchmark -- ImageNet -- has been decreasing by a factor of two every 16 months.\n\nApproaches like network pruning prior to training could lead to further gains. Research has shown that parameters pruned after training, a process that decreases the model size, could have been pruned before training without any effect on the network's ability to learn. Called the \"lottery ticket hypothesis,\" the idea is that the initial values parameters in a model receive are crucial for determining whether they're important. Parameters kept after pruning receive \"lucky\" initial values; the network can train successfully with only those parameters present.\n\nNetwork pruning is far from a solved science, however. New ways of pruning that work before or in early training will have to be developed, as most current methods apply only retroactively. And when parameters are pruned, the resulting structures aren't always a fit for the training hardware (e.g., GPUs), meaning that pruning 90% of parameters won't necessarily reduce the cost of training a model by 90%.\n\nWhether through pruning, novel AI accelerator hardware, or techniques like meta-learning and neural architecture search, the need for alternatives to unattainably large models is quickly becoming clear. A University of Massachusetts Amherst study showed that using 2019-era approaches, training an image recognition model with a 5% error rate would cost $100 billion and produce as much carbon emissions as New York City does in a month. As IEEE Spectrum's editorial team wrote in a recent piece, \"we must either adapt how we do deep learning or face a future of much slower progress.\"",

The brief provides recommendations designed to grow, sustain, and diversify the U.S. AI workforce. The authors employ a comprehensive definition of the AI workforce -- technical and nontechnical occupations -- and provide data-driven policy goals. They note that their recommendations are designed to leverage opportunities within the U.S. education and training system while mitigating its challenges, and prioritize equity in access and opportunity to AI education and AI careers.\n\nHere is the brief's Executive Summary:\n\nThe U.S. artificial intelligence workforce, which stood at 14 million people in 2019, or 9 percent of total U.S. employment, has grown rapidly in recent years. This trend is likely to continue, as AI occupational employment over the next decade is projected to grow twice as fast as employment in all occupations.\n\nSuch an important and increasing component of the U.S. workforce demands dedicated education and workforce policy. Yet one does not exist. To date, U.S. policy has been a piecemeal approach based on inconsistent definitions of the AI workforce. For some, current policy is focused on top-tier doctorates and immigration reform. For others, the conversation quickly reverts to STEM education.\n\nThis report addresses the need for a clearly defined AI education and workforce policy by providing recommendations designed to grow, sustain, and diversify the domestic AI workforce. We use a comprehensive definition of the AI workforce--technical and nontechnical occupations--and provide data-driven policy goals.\n\nOur policy goals and recommendations build off of previous CSET research along with new research findings presented here. Previous research in this series defined the AI workforce, described and characterized these workers, and assessed the relevant labor market dynamics. For example, we found that the demand for computer and information research scientists appears to be higher than the current supply, while for software developers and data scientists, evidence of a supply-demand gap is mixed.\n\nTo understand the current state of U.S. AI education for this report, we manually compiled an \"AI Education Catalog\" of curriculum offerings, summer camps, after-school programs, contests and challenges, scholarships, and related federal initiatives. To assess the current landscape of employer demand and hiring experiences, we also interviewed select companies engaged in AI activities.",

For them, the director of the complex, Daria Borisova, conducted a sightseeing tour, during which she spoke in detail about the activities of the center, its technical capabilities and modern approaches to youth education used here.\n\nThe representatives of Finland examined the administrative and educational, children's residential and sports buildings of the center. In the classrooms of the Airborne Forces and the Strategic Missile Forces, they tested their basic military training skills. So, with the help of simulators, the guests \"jumped with a parachute\", \"rode a combat vehicle\", \"fired from a weapon\".\n\nThe delegation also appreciated the center's own developments: the artificial intelligence of Avangard and Russia's first certified online platform in the field of military-patriotic education of youth.\n\nAccording to Daria Borisova, the visit of the Finnish delegation to Avangard will be the beginning of strong friendship and cooperation in the field of military-patriotic education of the younger generation.\n\n\"Our main principle is that education must keep pace with the times. Our center concentrates advanced technologies, the experience of several generations of Russian military personnel and the most modern approaches to training. We are glad that gradually they will learn about our center not only in Russia, but also abroad. And today we are glad to receive military attachés at the Finnish Embassy on defense issues and to conduct a dialogue on an important topic - the matter of educating the younger generation, \"said Daria Borisova.\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This article is a translation.

                "body": "China will strengthen its core capability in digital economy development and enhance the quality of digital economy, in a bid to build up the country's new strengths in digital economy, People's Daily reported.\n\nWith rapid development of emerging digital technologies, such as cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, digital economy has become the most active, influential industrial sector with fastest growth.\n\nThe scope and scale of digital economy have also been extended greatly, covering abundant products, services, business modes and industries.\n\nIn recent years, the global technology industry is facing increasingly fierce competition. Some major economies are sparing no efforts to strengthen their layouts in digital technological innovation, technical standards and international rulemaking, in order to seize opportunities from the competition.\n\nChina, depended on huge domestic market, has speeded up infrastructure construction, strengthened technological innovation, and propelled the digital economy at strong momentum. China has competitive edges in consumption and internet, becoming a major force to promote global digital economy development.\n\nDuring the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), China built the world's largest optical-fiber and 4G network, with over 99 percent of the villages across the country connected to both technologies. The number of 4G base stations also accounted for over half of the global total.\n\nAccording to a white paper released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, China's digital economy was worth nearly $5.4 trillion last year, ranking second in the world. That represented a year-on-year growth of 9.6 percent, the fastest in the world.\n\nChina has taken an active role in innovation of digital economy. In sectors such as mobile payment, Chinese original business modes emerged and led the world. Some startups witnessed rapid development, attracting a large amount of investment.\n\nMeanwhile, China's digital economy also has some problems, such as unbalanced development in different regions, industries and enterprises. Some core technologies, including precision sensors, integrated circuits, operating systems, industrial software, and open source platforms depend heavily on foreign companies.\n\nFaced with strengths and weaknesses, the country should seize opportunities to build its new advantages in digital economy as the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035 have pointed out.\n\nWith extensive market space and abundant application scenarios, China's digital economy development should be extended from consumption to the field of production, and enhance total-factor productivity of real economy.\n\nChina's digital economy has competitive edges in innovation of business modes. In the future, more efforts should be put in hard technologies, strengthen weakness in core technologies, and ensure stable development and industry safety of digital economy.\n\nAt present, China's strengths in digital economy embody more in products and services. In the coming years, more efforts should be put in technical standards and governance rules, and speed up the formulation of domestic digital technical standards, digital trade rules, and digital governance rules.\n\nSource: China Daily",

                "title": "What Legends of Tomorrow's Gideon Twist Means For The 100th Episode",
                "body": "Warning: The following contains SPOILERS for Legends of Tomorrow's season 7 premiere.\n\nGideon, the artificial intelligence that runs the Waverider on Legends of Tomorrow, was restored to life in the season 7 premiere, setting up the series' 100th episode, which will be told from her perspective. Usually presented as a holographic head, Gideon had previously only appeared \"in the flesh\" on Legends of Tomorrow in dream sequences and hallucinations; however, a magical mishap in the episode \"The Bullet Blondes\" gave Gideon a true physical form for the first time.\n\nDespite being the only original member of the Legends left on the series besides co-captain Sara Lance, Gideon is often overlooked. Reportedly created by Barry Allen as a digital assistant at some point in the future before being downloaded into a time-ship, Gideon rarely needs to speak up and make her presence known. Beyond running the higher functions of the Waverider, Gideon helped the Legends to restore Rip Hunter's memories after he was brainwashed by the Legion of Doom and assisted Zari Tomaz in breaking a time-loop that had trapped the team in the Legends of Tomorrow season 3 episode \"Here I Go Again.\"\n\nGideon was apparently destroyed forever in the Legends of Tomorrow season 6 finale after the Waverider was blown up by another time-ship. This left the Legends stranded in Odessa, Texas in the year 1925 with no apparent hope of rescue. This pushed Astra Logue to try and rebuild the Waverider using a resurrection spell she had learned from her mentor, John Constantine. The spell proved to be more than Astra could handle and the effort caused her to pass out before she could finish her incantation. However, when she later said the last word of the spell while talking with her best friend, Spooner Cruz, the residual magic sparked something in the Waverider wreckage, and a naked woman emerged from the rubble.\n\nGideon's resurrection and transformation comes in anticipation of Legends of Tomorrow's 100th episode, which is titled \"wvrdr_error_100 not found.\" Little is known about the episode's story beyond the fact that it will be told from Gideon's perspective and feature flashbacks to all the incarnations of the Legends of Tomorrow over the past six seasons. Logically, this makes sense, as Gideon was the only person who was there for everything that ever happened to the Legends, beginning with Time Master Rip Hunter going rogue, stealing a time-ship and recruiting eight people to help him kill the immortal supervillain destined to kill his family and conquer the Earth.\n\nRip Hunter will be one of many former Legends returning for a cameo in the Legends of Tomorrow 100th episode anniversary special. However, it is still unclear if Gideon's newfound humanity will be a permanent condition or if she'll be restored to her snarky synthetic form at some point in the future. In either case, mechanical lifeforms coping with humanity is one of the few science fiction tropes that Legends of Tomorrow has yet to satirize, so it seems likely that Gideon will be struggling with her new form for some time to come.\n\nMore: What Night Batwoman & Legends Of Tomorrow Air Now (New Time Slot Explained)\n\nShare Share Tweet Email 0 Comment Related Topics TV News SR Originals About The Author Matt Morrison (1667 Articles Published)\n\nMatt Morrison has been writing about comics since before the word \"blogging\" was coined.

To illustrate its point, CNN provided an Artificial Intelligence-manipulated photo of New York City's Times Square engulfed in wildfire smoke.\n\nNewsflash - wildfires have not engulfed New York City any time since SUVs were invented, nor will wildfires ever engulf New York City. Even if wildfires ever do engulf some area within hundreds of miles of New York City, the wildfires would almost certainly have been started by arsonists than climate change.\n\nIf we are going to talk about global warming and any alleged consequences, we have to look at global data. Although this past year has seen more wildfires than usual in California, with climate activists and their media sock puppets blaming global warming, NASA satellite instruments have been measuring the amount of land burned globally by wildfires since the 1990s. According to NASA, lands burned by wildfires have decreased by 24 percent since the satellite measurements first began.\n\nWildfires have always occurred on this planet and always will. When wildfires substantially decline as temperatures modestly warm - in conjunction with more precipitation and a greening of the Earth with more vegetation - it is counterfactual and dishonest to point to the fewer wildfires that still occur and claim that global warming is causing those that still occur.\n\nNo, CNN, wildfires are not destroying New York City, nor will they ever do so.",

                "body": "After being pummelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore's aerospace industry is slowly getting back on its feet with businesses looking to hire again.\n\nIndustry players said the worst may be over as travel resumes in some parts of the world and vaccine roll-outs continue to make progress, although they also cautioned of a bumpy route to recovery.\n\nEarlier this week, Manpower minister Tan See Leng announced at an industry event that aerospace companies in Singapore are looking to recruit 1,000 people over the next two years.\n\nAmong them include American aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, which is planning to add 250 more employees to its maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations in Singapore by the end of this year.\n\nAircraft engine and component provider GE Aviation is also hiring for 200 positions.\n\nBoth multinational firms have said they will continue to grow their workforce in Singapore in 2022, alongside the expected recovery of their industry.\n\nSingapore Technologies (ST) Engineering plans to hire up to 200 people by next year for full-time roles like aircraft technicians, production planners, materials inspectors, aircraft engineers and data analysts.\n\nOver at Singapore Aero Engine Services (SAESL) a joint venture between SIA Engineering and Rolls-Royce 100 more technicians and 70 trainees are needed.\n\nRecruitment has started about four months ago and the company expects these roles to be filled progressively through the rest of this year and into early 2022.\n\nIn addition, SAESL foresees \"at least another 100 (new hires) a year for the next two or three years\", in line with the industry's recovery, according to chief executive Simon Middlebrough.\n\nSIGNS OF RECOVERY\n\nSingapore is one of the world's leading aerospace MRO hubs, accounting for 10 per cent of global MRO output and employing more than 22,000 people.\n\nBut with airlines dramatically slashing flight schedules and planes grounded amid travel restrictions, the industry, which predominantly supports commercial aviation, suffered a heavy blow. Several companies, including Pratt & Whitney, Airbus and Rolls-Royce, laid off hundreds of workers in Singapore last year.\n\nThere are \"signs of recovery\", said the Association of Aerospace Industries (Singapore).\n\n\"The global airline industry is making progress from the deep losses suffered since last year, and should turn the corner into positive territory by 2023. The expectations for air cargo and passenger traffic are optimistic, with air cargo already above pre-COVID levels,\" the association's chief executive Sia Kheng Yok told CNA.\n\nSingapore's recent move to expand vaccinated travel lanes to 11 countries has also raised hopes, he added, noting that there \"appears to be pent-up demand\" among travellers.\n\nThe aerospace maintenance and manufacturing industry in Singapore serves a global market, which is also seeing signs of recovery with the restoration of domestic air travel in China, Europe and the United States.\n\nCiting official data that showed industry output rising 22 per cent in August from a year ago, as well as the hiring spree by companies, Sia said: \"While we can expect a bumpy ride ahead, the worst does seem to be over for aviation and aerospace.\"\n\nCOMPANIES FORGING AHEAD\n\nIain Rodger, managing director of GE Aviation in Singapore, said the company is seeing a continued recovery of the aviation sector as countries open up their borders progressively.\n\n\"We are experiencing positive growth in the second half of 2021 and we are optimistic about 2022, as the industry continues its multi-year recovery,\" he said.\n\nOver at ST Engineering, its commercial aerospace business secured new contracts worth about S$874 million in the second quarter of this year. These included passenger-to-freighter conversion orders and MRO contracts.\n\n\"While we have indeed seen a number of major RFPs (request for proposals) and new orders as some airlines renew their existing contracts and as flying activities slowly pick up, most of the maintenance activities are still in support of domestic travel and freighters, which saw increased demand during the pandemic,\" said the firm's commercial aerospace president Jeffrey Lam.\n\n\"However, we believe that the market has bottomed and is on a gradual recovery trajectory.\"\n\nST Engineering said it remains \"very positive\" about the industry's growth and prospects, and will continue to build up its MRO capabilities in airframe, component and engine.\n\nIt will also continue to grow its passenger-to-freighter conversion business an opportunity it seized last year by repurposing under-utilised A321 passenger aircraft into freighters for air cargo.\n\nThis has been a bright spot for the firm amid the downturn, and continues to see strong demand due to a booming e-commerce industry, said Lam. Already it has set up a freighter leasing joint venture with Temasek in August last year.\n\n\"Through this new venture, we will address the growing demand for freighter aircraft as e-commerce and air cargo volumes expand across the globe, while at the same time leverage our deep technical expertise to provide end-to-end solutions including entry to service, deployment and maintenance,\" Lam added.\n\nSAESL's Middlebrough said the aerospace industry \"is a very difficult beast to predict as a whole\" but he sees certain geographies and market segments making quicker recoveries.\n\nFor instance, short-haul domestic and regional travel will likely make a comeback before international long-haul flights. With that, narrow-body jets are likely to see greater demand.\n\nAirlines are also more likely to bring their most cost-effective, fuel-efficient and sustainable aircraft back into service first.\n\nSAESL stands to benefit from these trends. \"I service Rolls-Royce engines and Rolls-Royce engines are favourably skewed towards that new end of the life cycle,\" said the chief executive.\n\nThat said, industry players are well aware of the turbulence ahead with the continued spread of the more infectious Delta variant.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong, I think there will still be bumps in the road over the next six to 12 months but we have to start planning for the macro recovery now,\" said Middlebrough.\n\nAirbus said although there are clear signs of recovery in most regions, it does not expect a return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest.\n\nThis is because with MRO services severely impacted due to the grounding of fleets, a \"meaningful recovery in the sector will only come\" with the return to service of these aircraft.\n\nAnand Stanley, Airbus' president for Asia-Pacific, added: \"Until there is a general acceptance of this fact (that COVID-19 needs to be seen as an endemic) and a meaningful reopening of borders without restrictive quarantines, the aviation sector in the region will continue to lag recovery elsewhere.\"\n\nNonetheless, the company said it is \"fully committed to its presence in Singapore\" which serves as its regional hub.\n\n\"When the airline market in the region recovers, we will review our plans for the future, which will include growing further our presence in Singapore,\" Stanley added in an emailed response to CNA.\n\nNEW OPPORTUNITIES, TALENT\n\nManpower minister Dr Tan also said in his speech the industry can seize growth opportunities in digital services, autonomous technologies and sustainability moving forward.\n\nCommenting on that, Sia said the downturn has accelerated the pace of digital transformation for aviation and aerospace, with the industry rolling out new digital services to airlines and drawing on data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop better solutions.\n\nThere is also a push towards the development of autonomous capabilities for ground operations at airports and to assist flight operations. One example is the proliferation of air taxi concepts that are designed for autonomous operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the industry is working on a \"green recovery\" given rising concerns about the impact of air travel on climate change.\n\nFor instance, sustainable technologies like sustainable aviation fuel, electric and hydrogen propulsion are a priority agenda for aircraft manufacturers. The Association of Aerospace Industries also launched an inaugural report recently on the adoption of solar energy by aerospace companies in Singapore.\n\n\"These changes herald a brave new post-pandemic future for the aviation and aerospace industry. The Singapore workforce and businesses will need to adapt and thrive in this environment,\" Sia said.\n\nOn ensuring a ready talent pool, the association said it will continue to play its role as \"an interlocutor\" between industry, government agencies, and the institutes of higher learning.\n\n\"We are currently studying the key role that talent will play in the industry's recovery and are exploring ideas to prepare Singaporeans for the future shape of the industry,\" said Sia.\n\nBusinesses said they are already investing in these areas.\n\nFor instance, Thales told CNA in an emailed interview in September that with the pandemic accelerating the rate of digital transformation for many sectors, it had also picked up the pace on this by investing in digital tools and infrastructure to streamline and shorten its internal processes.\n\n\"We leverage the Thales Digital Factory in Singapore taking a scrum approach and working with agile teams to identify areas of improvements within our processes so we have higher efficiency and optimised outputs,\" said Francois Piolet, vice-president and general manager of Aviation Global Services for APAC and China.\n\nRodger from GE Aviation said the company continues to invest in its people to develop their skills in current and future technologies.\n\n\"We are also seeking to grow our talent and technicians in all areas such as machining, welding and coating as well as engineers for new and emerging technologies.\"",

                "body": "Tokyo - If the properties of materials can be reliably predicted, then the process of developing new products for a huge range of industries can be streamlined and accelerated. In a study published XXX in Advanced Intelligent Systems, researchers from The University of Tokyo Institute of Industrial Science used core-loss spectroscopy to determine the properties of organic molecules using machine learning.\n\nThe spectroscopy techniques energy loss near-edge structure (ELNES) and X-ray near-edge structure (XANES) are used to determine information about the electrons, and through that the atoms, in materials. They have high sensitivity and high resolution and have been used to investigate a range of materials from electronic devices to drug delivery systems.\n\nHowever, connecting spectral data to the properties of a material -- things like optical properties, electron conductivity, density, and stability -- remains ambiguous. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been used to extract information for large complex sets of data. Such approaches use artificial neural networks, which are based on how our brains work, to constantly learn to solve problems. Although the group previously used ELNES/XANES spectra and ML to find out information about materials, what they found did not relate to the properties of the material itself. Therefore, the information could not be easily translated into developments.\n\nNow the team has used ML to reveal information hidden in the simulated ELNES/XANES spectra of 22,155 organic molecules. \"The ELNES/XANES spectra of the molecules, or their \"descriptors\" in this scenario, were then input into the system,\" explains lead author Kakeru Kikumasa. \"This descriptor is something that can be directly measured in experiments and can therefore be determined with high sensitivity and resolution. This method is highly beneficial for materials development because it has the potential to reveal where, when, and how certain material properties arise.\"\n\nA model created from the spectra alone was able to successfully predict what are known as intensive properties. However, it was unable to predict extensive properties, which are dependent on the molecular size. Therefore, to improve the prediction, the new model was constructed by including the ratios of three elements in relation to carbon (which is present in all organic molecules) as extra parameters to allow extensive properties such as the molecular weight to be correctly predicted.\n\n\"Our ML learning treatment of core-loss spectra provides accurate prediction of extensive material properties, such as internal energy and molecular weight. The link between core-loss spectra and extensive properties has previously never been made; however, artificial intelligence was able to unveil the hidden connections. Our approach might also be applied to predict the properties of new materials and functions\" says senior author Teruyasu Mizoguchi. \"We believe that our model will be a very useful tool for the high-throughput development of materials in a wide range of industries.\"\n\nThe study, \"Quantification of the Properties of Organic Molecules Using Core-Loss Spectra as Neural Network Descriptors\", was published in Advanced Intelligent Systems at DOI: 10.1002/aisy.202100103.\n\nAbout Institute of Industrial Science (IIS), the University of Tokyo\n\nInstitute of Industrial Science (IIS), the University of Tokyo is one of the largest university-attached research institutes in Japan.\n\nMore than 120 research laboratories, each headed by a faculty member, comprise IIS, with more than 1,200 members including approximately 400 staff and 800 students actively engaged in education and research. Our activities cover almost all the areas of engineering disciplines. Since its foundation in 1949, IIS has worked to bridge the huge gaps that exist between academic disciplines and realworld applications.",

                "title": "You can switch off Siri, but not the State",
                "body": "The Dussehra break gave me a chance to head to the hills. Seven hours away from Delhi, in Uttarakhand, you are surrounded by lush foliage, hills, hiking trails and even rumours of a lurking leopard. It was in this setting that I started Nobel Prize-winning author Kazuo Ishiguro's new book, Klara and the Sun, about a place in which children have AFs or artificial friends, machines with AI that were programmed to respond to human beings -- as they observed more, they stored more information about their owners and knew how to respond to them.\n\nKlara, the AF, could soon mimic the behaviour, speech, walk and all manner of responses of the child she was bought for. The trouble began when the parent started finding Klara more perfect than her child. Ishiguro asks us a deep question: Is love substitutable? For our purposes, the book describes the process of \"deep learning\" where artificial intelligence programmes are able to absorb information and start demonstrating reasoning of the kind which distinguishes us as humans.\n\nThe scenario Ishiguro describes is not science fiction or a far-fetched rendition of the future. As India gingerly moves towards completing the second year of pandemic living, one trend is certain -- we will rely more and more on artificial intelligence to get through our day. In 1956, John McCarthy wrote, \"Artificial intelligence is allowing a machine to behave in such a way that it would be called intelligent if a human being behaved in such a way.\" Siri, which Apple consumers are dependent on, is an example of artificial intelligence. Yet for Siri to be intelligent, to recognise even a cat, Siri's creators said it needed to be fed almost 1,00,000 pictures of cats to spot one when you ask her.\n\nWe are now in an era, defined by a Covid-inspired retreat into the digital or virtual world. In the world's largest democracy of 1.7 billion people, increasingly more and more citizens have vital information on themselves stored as part of state or private data platforms. The government collects information for Aadhaar, for vaccinations on CoWin, from our tax returns, from our driving licence and a host of other instruments that enable us to navigate the public world of citizenship.\n\nPrivate platforms like Facebook, Twitter and a host of others collect what makes us unique -- our opinions, our likes and dislikes, our ideologies -- on their platforms. Based on this data, algorithms drive news and information that aligns with our beliefs to our Twitter or Facebook selves. Meanwhile, we now consume popular culture on the privacy of our laptops through OTT platforms like Amazon Prime, Netflix or Hotstar, instead of going to the theatre. Algorithms on each of these platforms recommend movies or serials we like based on our prior viewing.\n\nBut the use of algorithms is not just restricted to movie recommendations. It is being used in many parts of the United States to predict recidivism likelihood amongst prisoners and, therefore, to grant sentences based on machine predictions. With this come biases -- after all, the data being fed to create the algorithms reflects the opinions of the programmers feeding the information. For instance, is the zip code of where a person lives likely to indicate chances of committing fresh crimes? If you live in a white neighbourhood, are you less likely to commit a new crime? How does one make the algorithm fair and transparent?\n\nIn India, for all this data collection that is underway constantly, in a seemingly irreversible manner, citizens have no rights over their data or protection from its extraction and in general, against its misuse. There is no data protection law in place, even though a Bill is being discussed by the parliamentary committee on information technology. Our only protection at present is the Supreme Court's judgment in Puttaswamy, where it ruled that citizens have rights to informational privacy. Yet, in the absence of legislation, this proves difficult to implement.\n\nWhile the state has unilateral rights to collect and use our data, it has also given itself the ability to regulate private parties. For instance, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 are used to mandate that WhatsApp, which uses end-to-end encryption, must enable the identification of the first originator of the information. At present, it is as if the state can have deep learning on its citizens. In turn, we the citizens have no remedies for the abuse of that learning. You can switch off Siri, but not the state.\n\nOur government is thinking about the potential and inevitability of the greater use of AI. The 2018 Niti Aayog National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence points to the greater need for AI in sectors like education, healthcare and agriculture. Niti Aayog notes that impediments to the greater use of AI include the lack of access to data, concerns for privacy and security. While noting these concerns, the papers also make clear that the aims of state policy include creating a data marketplace -- a \"deployable model\" in which it seeks to bring \"buyers and sellers of data together\".\n\nAmid these plans for greater deployment of AI and harvesting of our data, the lack of any rights paradigm provided by law is deeply unsettling. It violates a constitutional premise that citizens must have their speech, expression, intellectual property and liberty rights protected. In the absence of these protections, the state will continue its deep learning about us and harvest what makes us human and defines our personalities -- our personal data.",

                "body": "If the properties of materials can be reliably predicted, then the process of developing new products for a huge range of industries can be streamlined and accelerated. In a study published in Advanced Intelligent Systems, researchers from The University of Tokyo Institute of Industrial Science used core-loss spectroscopy to determine the properties of organic molecules using machine learning.\n\nThe spectroscopy techniques energy loss near-edge structure (ELNES) and X-ray near-edge structure (XANES) are used to determine information about the electrons, and through that the atoms, in materials. They have high sensitivity and high resolution and have been used to investigate a range of materials from electronic devices to drug delivery systems.\n\nHowever, connecting spectral data to the properties of a material -- things like optical properties, electron conductivity, density, and stability -- remains ambiguous. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been used to extract information for large complex sets of data. Such approaches use artificial neural networks, which are based on how our brains work, to constantly learn to solve problems. Although the group previously used ELNES/XANES spectra and ML to find out information about materials, what they found did not relate to the properties of the material itself. Therefore, the information could not be easily translated into developments.\n\nNow the team has used ML to reveal information hidden in the simulated ELNES/XANES spectra of 22,155 organic molecules. \"The ELNES/XANES spectra of the molecules, or their \"descriptors\" in this scenario, were then input into the system,\" explains lead author Kakeru Kikumasa. \"This descriptor is something that can be directly measured in experiments and can therefore be determined with high sensitivity and resolution. This method is highly beneficial for materials development because it has the potential to reveal where, when, and how certain material properties arise.\"\n\nA model created from the spectra alone was able to successfully predict what are known as intensive properties. However, it was unable to predict extensive properties, which are dependent on the molecular size. Therefore, to improve the prediction, the new model was constructed by including the ratios of three elements in relation to carbon (which is present in all organic molecules) as extra parameters to allow extensive properties such as the molecular weight to be correctly predicted.\n\n\"Our ML learning treatment of core-loss spectra provides accurate prediction of extensive material properties, such as internal energy and molecular weight. The link between core-loss spectra and extensive properties has previously never been made; however, artificial intelligence was able to unveil the hidden connections. Our approach might also be applied to predict the properties of new materials and functions\" says senior author Teruyasu Mizoguchi. \"We believe that our model will be a very useful tool for the high-throughput development of materials in a wide range of industries.\"\n\nReference: \"Quantification of the Properties of Organic Molecules Using Core-Loss Spectra as Neural Network Descriptors\" 15 October 2021, Advanced Intelligent Systems.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/aisy.202100103",

                "body": "Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, on Thursday called out the need for better methodologies for identification and improvement of algorithms prone to mirroring \"systemic biases\" in the healthcare system and the data used to train artificial intelligence and machine learning-based devices, speaking at an FDA public workshop on the topic.\n\nThe medical device industry should develop a strategy to enroll racially and ethnically diverse populations in clinical trials.\n\n\"It's essential that the data used to train [these] devices represent the intended patient population with regards to age, gender, sex, race and ethnicity,\" Shuren said.\n\nThe virtual workshop comes nine months after the agency released an action plan for establishing a regulatory approach to AI/ML-based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD). Among the five actions laid out in the plan, FDA intends to foster a patient-centered approach that includes device transparency for users.\n\nJack Resneck, president-elect of the American Medical Association, said \"the less transparency there is about a tool and its development, the less we're going to be able to counsel our patients about the risks and benefits.\"\n\nResneck said the physician group wants to see FDA focus on patient outcomes and clinical validation with published peer-reviewed data to develop trust regarding AI/ML-based medical devices, while taking steps to guard against bias and exacerbating healthcare disparities in already vulnerable populations.\n\n\"The 'just trust us' approach from an entrepreneur or developer isn't going to be enough for us to be able to reassure our patients,\" Resneck remarked.\n\nThe purpose of Thursday's workshop was to gather feedback from stakeholders to identify the types of information that FDA might recommend manufacturers include in the labeling of AI/ML-based medical devices to support transparency.\n\nResneck said the AMA wants to see labeling with a level of transparency and explainability related to how the devices will be deployed and how much risk they involve.\n\nPat Baird, senior regulatory specialist at Philips, noted that the general principles of labeling \"have been around for decades\" and, after talking recently to other medtechs, device manufacturers \"want to understand what additional information is needed from the caregivers and patients.\"\n\nHowever, at the same time, Baird cautioned about the pitfalls of \"information overload\" and inundating patients with too many details. \"Labeling needs to be helpful and not overwhelming,\" Baird added.\n\nFDA contends transparent device development and evaluation requires a total product lifecycle approach that enables the agency and manufacturers to evaluate and monitor such devices from premarket through postmarket real-world performance.\n\nBakul Patel, director of FDA's Digital Health Center of Excellence, said the agency must have \"appropriately tailored oversight\" ensuring that the benefits of the AI/ML-based devices outweigh the risks to patients, while taking into account usability, trust, equity and accountability.\n\n\"The safety and effectiveness of these novel technologies are still unclear to patients and providers,\" Patel said, adding that FDA is seeking to tailor its regulatory approach for these \"emerging technologies that bring new challenges\" as well as opportunities.\n\nFDA intends to publish draft guidance in 2021 including a proposal of what should be included in a SaMD Pre-Specifications (SPS) and Algorithm Change Protocol (ACP) to support the safety and effectiveness of AI/ML-based devices as the associated algorithms change over time.\n\nSPS is meant to describe what aspects the manufacturer intends to change through learning, and ACP explains how the algorithm will learn and change while remaining safe and effective.\n\n\"To achieve transparency, we must first understand what [it] means to those who are using this technology and what factors play in building that trust,\" Patel concluded.",

The fair, which attracts more than 30,000 exhibitors offline and online, is the world's largest in-person trade fair since the coronavirus outbreak. It also witnessed the attendance of Chinese Premier at the grand opening ceremony and a trade forum, which raised the confidence of attendees in China's focus to boost trade.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the fair on Thursday, saying that China is willing to join hands with all other nations and practice real multilateralism to build a world economy featuring high-level openness.\n\nThe five-day event, which will officially start on Friday and last till Tuesday, attended by government officials and business executives, is expected to further expand cooperation, exchanges and sales between China and other countries. A total of 7,795 companies will display their latest technologies and products in a 400,000-square-meter exhibition area, and an additional 26,000 firms will exhibit their goods online.\n\nThe Canton Fair has been held every spring and autumn since its first launch in 1957 and has been seen as a barometer of China's foreign trade.\n\nHolding the fair not only marks the Chinese economy's \"genuine\" recovery after the coronavirus hit, but also demonstrates China's responsibility and capability to secure global supplies during major crises, experts said.\n\n\"It shows China's services and supply chains have normalized (after COVID-19), which is significant to stabilizing global supplies and rejuvenating the world economy,\" Zhu Qiucheng, CEO of Ningbo New Oriental Electric Industrial Development and also an exhibitor, told the Global Times.\n\nOpening-up message\n\nAddressing the opening ceremony of the Canton Fair, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang urged the international community to carry out fair, free and mutual-beneficial trade, while saying that countries should play to their own strengths to expand global markets jointly.\n\nLi pledged to keep the Chinese market as the \"fertile soil\" for foreign investment and continue to shrink the list of sectors that are off-limits to foreign investors.\n\nChina will actively participate in improving the international trade rules, and advance forward trade and investment liberalization, Li said.\n\nThe country will push the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership to go into effect along with the pact's other members. It will also actively advance the process of joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership while moving to sign more high-standard free trade deals.\n\nXi's congratulatory letter and Li's speech sent the message that China is determined to embrace opening-up despite external challenges, a direction which has and will help China meet its economic ambitions, experts said.\n\n\"China is sending a firm signal to the whole world that it will stick to opening-up and closely link its economy with the world economy,\" Tian Yun, former vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times.\n\nHe said it would be an inevitable trend for trade to play an increasingly important role in fueling economic growth, when other sectors, like properties, are in a process of correction to prevent risks.\n\nWang Peng, an assistant professor at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at the Renmin University of China, also said that holding of the Canton Fair amid a global pandemic may be more significant to the world (than normal times), as it shows that China's determination to open up will not be stopped despite multiple negative consequences caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"It means China's development strategies of dual circulation do not close the gates to the world, but generate more opportunities to international cooperation partners,\" he said.\n\nDuring the 130th Canton Fair, the Hong Kong economy has become a highlight. On Thursday, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Carrie Lam attended the Pearl River International Trade Forum, held for the first time during the Canton Fair.\n\nLi also said that China will establish digital trade pilot areas in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, while pushing for the construction of overseas smart logistics platforms in the area.\n\n\"This is an encouraging sign that Hong Kong is increasingly integrating into the mainland's development,\" Tian said. He noted that the merging of Hong Kong's efficient trade networks and the mainland's manufacturing would not only boost Hong Kong's trade, but can mold the Greater Bay Area into the world's most influential economic zone.\n\nFeeling thrilled\n\nThe government's embrace of opening-up policies and focus on boosting trade also generated optimism among the exhibitors, who expressed confidence in China's trade prospects.\n\nYing Xiuzhen, president of China-Base Ningbo Foreign Trade Company, told the Global Times that holding the Canton Fair amid pandemic makes her feel excited and confident, as it showed the government is attaching great importance to the trade sector.\n\nAs a veteran trader, she said she felt there's \"nothing to fear,\" as China's trade development has been very \"normal\" in whatever difficulties the country faces, whether they be the Asian financial crisis or the US tariff hikes.\n\nLuo Guiping, a staff member of Primary Corporation, a Shenzhen-based kitchen and bath facilities provider, told the Global Times on Thursday that after three suspensions of offline fairs due to the effects of the pandemic, the resumption of the Canton Fair has significant meaning for her company.\n\n\"Although the combination of online and in-person exhibition will bring challenges and opportunities for us, I have confidence that our business will expand under the new international circumstances,\" Luo said.\n\nThe Global Times saw approximately 600 people attending the opening ceremony in person, most of whom were representatives of exhibitors who will attend the fair in person and buyers from all over the world.\n\nPeople talked excitedly and took photos in front of the Canton Fair logo. Many of the exhibitors said that they still cannot believe that such a big international fair is being held in person amid the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.\n\nSource: Global Times",

                "title": "CCP Poses 'Insider Threat' to American Companies: Former Pentagon Official",
                "body": "Jan Jekielek is a Senior Editor with The Epoch Times and host of the show, \"American Thought Leaders.\" Jan's career has spanned academia, media, & international human rights work. In 2009 he joined The Epoch Times full time and has served in a variety of roles, including as Website Chief Editor. He is the producer of the award-winning Holocaust documentary film \"Finding Manny.\"\n\nA former Pentagon official has warned that the Chinese Communist Party is sending people to infiltrate American businesses. In addition, the Department of Defense needs to do a better job of working with the tech industry to prevent China from achieving dominance in the field of artificial intelligence, the former official said.\n\n\"The fact is, the Chinese Communist Party is really sending a lot of people to our universities and to our most innovative companies,\" said Nicolas Chaillan, the former chief software officer for the U.S. Air Force and Space Force. \"And there is a very big risk of exfiltration of data from within.\"\n\n\"Insider threat is probably the most underestimated threat of all these top organizations on the commercial side,\" he added.\n\nThe comments were made during an appearance on EpochTV's \"American Thought Leaders\" program to be aired on Oct. 16 at 7 p.m., following Chaillan's highly publicized resignation as the Pentagon's first chief software officer.\n\nChaillan said that a key issue in mitigating insider threat in the future would be striking a balance between an appropriate amount of caution regarding those with ties to the Chinese regime, while still maintaining America's democratic values.\n\n\"It's a real issue, and there's not many solutions,\" Chaillan said. \"You don't want to start saying 'we're not going to allow these people to contribute to society.' We need those talents.\"\n\nTo that end, Chaillan said that a key factor in securing American industry would be working to effectively sever U.S.-based workers' dependency on and ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Current U.S. policy prohibits the immigration of CCP members to the United States.\n\n\"If they're willing to come and make a difference, they can actually be great assets to by providing more insights about their countries,\" Chaillan said. \"So, I think the solution would have to deal with how do we help them bring their families and try to remove these dependencies or these kind of side effects and risks that could be spreading rapidly. You have to be proactive.\"\n\n\"At some point it's a gamble, but there is more risk not doing it sometimes than doing it.\"\n\nChaillan also said that the CCP's ability to control China-based companies and leverage their technologies was a key factor in his decision to resign from the DoD.\n\n\"China is taking off, leading the pace, by mandating their companies to partner with them,\" Chaillan said. \"That's been a tremendous challenge and, at some point, I had no choice but to raise the alarm because we are seeing that we're losing this battle.\"\n\n\"China is leading right now, they're already leading in many of those fields because of the adoption of the technology from their companies. That's the difference.\"\n\nChaillan explained that a lack of transparency between the Pentagon and the private technology sector was driving down the industry's desire to work with government, and that an inability to leverage private sector tech was hamstringing U.S. efforts to compete with China.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the U.S. companies are all leading against China, but we [the DoD] do not have access to that technology,\" Chaillan said. \"So that puts us behind because, effectively, we're left not being able to partner and competing at the same time with a massive country with 1.5 billion people that are not waiting for us to wake up.\"\n\nThat lack of communication and the at times hostile culture towards the military in big tech firms have become something of a problem in recent years.\n\nPerhaps the most notable example of such was when Google opted not to continue a government contract that would have improved the accuracy of drones by leveraging AI and big data, but continued to develop AI resources that were known to benefit the CCP.\n\nThe move, and others like it, were roundly criticized as an effective collaboration between the CCP and its military wing, the People's Liberation Army.\n\nNumerous companies including Apple, Google, IBM, and Microsoft all still maintain AI research laboratories in mainland China, where the CCP can leverage national security laws to compel those companies to hand over trade secrets at any time.\n\nSecurity experts have since called for a ban on AI transfers to China to help mitigate the risk posed to the United States by such policies, but Chaillan said that what is really needed is a more serious vetting of who is working in tech, and a renewed dedication to developing results-driven platforms in the military.\n\n\"We have to pay attention to who is working for some of these companies,\" Chaillan said.\n\n\"But what's very important is we have to stop funding reports. We have to ask Congress to stop continuously going back to DoD and asking the department to invest more money writing reports.\"\n\n\"We need actions. We need outcomes. We need tangible value to the warfighter.\"\n\nTo that end, Chaillan's time at the Pentagon included developing and deploying a working model for the Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2), an inter-service network that would combine sensors from across the Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy, and Space Force.\n\nThe unexpected cancellation of funding for JADC2, which was described as \"best of breed\" by Air Force officials just months ago, was a key factor in Chaillan's departure from the DoD.\n\nStill, though Chaillan believes that the window of opportunity is quickly closing for the United States to avoid losing the AI war with China, he maintained that not all hope was lost.\n\n\"I don't believe that we have lost,\" Chaillan said. \"What I said is that if we don't act now, and don't wake up right away, and not in five to 10 years from now like some of the Pentagon reports are saying, but if we don't take a stand now and take action, we have no fighting chance in succeeding 10 to 15 years from now.\"\n\n\"The velocity of adoption of AI compounds over time so, effectively, you're going to be at a situation at some point where you pass the point of no return. You will not be able to catch up.\"\n\nAccordingly, Chaillan said that the DoD must do more to encourage innovative thinking and risk-taking among its ranks, as well as to increase transparency with its private-sector contractors.\n\n\"Well, you know, I think that the issue is there is no reward for taking risks,\" Chaillan said. \"On the commercial side, if you do good you get bonuses, you get credit, right? In the government, it's actually safer not to take [risks], because you have more chance of rising up if you don't make noise, even if you end up having a large program that fails.\"\n\n\"There's no one held accountable when something goes wrong,\" Chaillan added. \"Effectively, when something is going to go wrong, it's going to be most likely classified, and we can't talk about it.\"\n\nWhen asked to comment on Chaillan's remarks, the DoD referred The Epoch Times to comments made by press secretary John Kirby during a press conference on Oct. 12.\n\n\"[Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin] was very clear about our concerns about China's desires to advance in this field and he's focused and we still remain focused on advancing AI capabilities in a responsible way, in close partnership with industry and academia and building a digitally talented and capable workforce here for the Department,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"What I can tell you is that we recognize the importance of AI as a technology and as a capability and the Secretary has spoken about this and we have invested quite a bit of effort and energy into making sure that we can advance AI technology in a responsible way.\"",

                "body": "If the properties of materials can be reliably predicted, then the process of developing new products for a huge range of industries can be streamlined and accelerated. In a study published in Advanced Intelligent Systems, researchers from The University of Tokyo Institute of Industrial Science used core-loss spectroscopy to determine the properties of organic molecules using machine learning.\n\nThe spectroscopy techniques energy loss near-edge structure (ELNES) and X-ray near-edge structure (XANES) are used to determine information about the electrons, and through that the atoms, in materials. They have high sensitivity and high resolution and have been used to investigate a range of materials from electronic devices to drug delivery systems.\n\nHowever, connecting spectral data to the properties of a material -- things like optical properties, electron conductivity, density, and stability -- remains ambiguous. Machine learning (ML) approaches have been used to extract information for large complex sets of data. Such approaches use artificial neural networks, which are based on how our brains work, to constantly learn to solve problems. Although the group previously used ELNES/XANES spectra and ML to find out information about materials, what they found did not relate to the properties of the material itself. Therefore, the information could not be easily translated into developments.\n\nNow the team has used ML to reveal information hidden in the simulated ELNES/XANES spectra of 22,155 organic molecules. \"The ELNES/XANES spectra of the molecules, or their \"descriptors\" in this scenario, were then input into the system,\" explains lead author Kakeru Kikumasa. \"This descriptor is something that can be directly measured in experiments and can therefore be determined with high sensitivity and resolution. This method is highly beneficial for materials development because it has the potential to reveal where, when, and how certain material properties arise.\"\n\nA model created from the spectra alone was able to successfully predict what are known as intensive properties. However, it was unable to predict extensive properties, which are dependent on the molecular size. Therefore, to improve the prediction, the new model was constructed by including the ratios of three elements in relation to carbon (which is present in all organic molecules) as extra parameters to allow extensive properties such as the molecular weight to be correctly predicted.\n\n\"Our ML learning treatment of core-loss spectra provides accurate prediction of extensive material properties, such as internal energy and molecular weight. The link between core-loss spectra and extensive properties has previously never been made; however, artificial intelligence was able to unveil the hidden connections. Our approach might also be applied to predict the properties of new materials and functions\" says senior author Teruyasu Mizoguchi. \"We believe that our model will be a very useful tool for the high-throughput development of materials in a wide range of industries.\"\n\nReference: \"Quantification of the Properties of Organic Molecules Using Core-Loss Spectra as Neural Network Descriptors\" 15 October 2021, Advanced Intelligent Systems.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/aisy.202100103",

                "body": "1 of 2\n\nApp connects farmers to services\n\nAn application was recently released by the Practical Farmers of Iowa. The app is designed to help farmers easily locate cover-crop seed, services and suppliers in time for fall 2021 planting decisions. The app, \"Find Cover Crops,\" is free to download and use, and is available in both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. The Practical Farmers of Iowa worked with North Carolina-based Onyx Ocean Technologies, a mobile app and web-design company, to develop the app, which is funded by a three-year Gulf of Mexico Division Farmer to Farmer grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Email michael@practicalfarmers.org to have a cover-crop business added to the app. Visit practicalfarmers.org for more information.\n\nTool helps crop-input decisions\n\nA tool recently developed by a University of Minnesota research team allows farmers to create a budget balance sheet of any nitrogen-reduction plans and see the economic and environmental cost, return and margins, all customized to fields under their management.\n\nAs outlined in an article published in IOPscience, the research team built a series of machine-learning-based metamodels that can almost perfectly mimic a well-tested crop model at much faster speeds. Using the metamodels, they generated millions of scenario simulations and investigated two fundamental sustainability questions -- where the mitigation hotspots are and how much mitigation can be expected under different management scenarios.\n\nIn the future, the team will expand the framework presented in the study and develop more advanced and accurate carbon-qualification models through a combination of process-based models, artificial intelligence and remote sensing.\n\nThe research was funded by the University of Minnesota AGREETT program, the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy. Visit iopscience.iop.org for more information.\n\nSurvey targets soybean farmers\n\nA team of economists from the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois invites soybean farmers in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Indiana and Nebraska -- the top-five soybean-producing states in the United States -- to take a short survey on how they consider and adopt new precision and digital agricultural technologies.\n\nGary Schnitkey, professor in agricultural and consumer economics and soybean industry chair in agricultural strategy, and Joana Colussi, a doctoral candidate in the department of agricultural and consumer economics, are working with colleagues in Brazil to measure the influence of various communication channels on farmers' decisions in both countries. The researchers already collected data in Brazil's top soybean-producing states; they ask U.S. farmers in the five Midwestern states to complete the survey during July and August.\n\nThe survey takes five to eight minutes to complete, and responses are confidential. At the end of the questionnaire, participants can provide an email address to receive the survey results. Visit bit.ly/agricommunication to take the survey and for more information.\n\nUSDA invests millions in grants\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture recently stated that $700 million in competitive grant funding will be available through the new Farm and Food Workers Relief grant program to help farmworkers and meatpacking workers with pandemic-related health and safety costs.\n\nAdditionally, to recognize the essential role and costs borne by front-line grocery workers, $20 million of that amount has been set aside for at least one pilot program to support grocery workers and test options for reaching them in the future. The new program is funded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and is part of USDA's Build Back Better efforts to respond and recover from the pandemic.\n\nThe program will provide relief to farmworkers, meatpacking workers and front-line grocery workers for expenses incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The relief is intended to defray costs for reasonable and necessary personal, family or living expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as costs for personal protective equipment, dependent care and expenses associated with quarantines and testing related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds will be awarded through grants to state agencies, Tribal entities and nonprofit organizations serving farmworkers and meatpacking workers ranging from $5 million to $50 million. Visit www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/ffwr for more information.\n\nWisconsin hemp program to transition\n\nThe Wisconsin hemp program, currently administered by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, will transition to the U.S. Department of Agriculture starting January 1, 2022.\n\nStates and tribal nations have the ability to transition their hemp program to USDA. Currently three other states - Hawaii, Mississippi and New Hampshire - and multiple tribal nations have federal-run hemp programs. Many producers already work with their local USDA Farm Service Agency offices to report their crops, so the transition aligns with processes already occurring.\n\nAnother benefit of a federal-run program is no licensing fees; the federal license is three years instead of annual, and it provides some flexibility utilizing private sampling and testing services. A federal-run hemp program also streamlines program rule changes because growers will need to comply with just the federal program rules. To date the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection has had to promulgate emergency rule changes, update program operations and conduct outreach to growers when a federal rule change was made.\n\nGov. Tony Evers' 2021-2023 budget proposal provided ongoing staffing resources to support the hemp program, but those resources were not included in the final version of the budget passed by the legislature. Growers will continue to work with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection for the current growing season for harvest notifications, sample collection and testing until Dec. 31, 2021. Starting Jan. 1, 2022, hemp growers will transition to the federal-run program, but hemp processors will no longer need a Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection license to process hemp. Hemp processors will remain under the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection's current authority for consumer and food products. Visit hemp.wi.gov for more information.\n\nNew insurance option available\n\nCorn farmers who \"split apply\" nitrogen will soon have another option for insurance coverage. Beginning in crop year 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency will offer the Post Application Coverage Endorsement in certain states for non-irrigated corn, providing coverage for producers who use that practice that is considered better for natural resources and saves money for producers.\n\nTo \"split-apply\" nitrogen, growers make multiple fertilizer applications during the growing season rather than providing all of the crop's nitrogen requirements with a single treatment before or during planting. The Post Application Coverage Endorsement will provide payments for the projected yield lost when producers are unable to apply the in-season nitrogen application.\n\n\"Split application\" of nitrogen can lead to less input costs as well as helps prevent runoff or leaching of nutrients into waterways and groundwater. That is because it is used in more targeted amounts over multiple applications, rather than one large application.\n\nThe new crop insurance option builds upon the Risk Management Agency's efforts to encourage use of conservation practices, including cover crops. The policy change supports use of cover crops, which can help producers build resilience to drought.\n\nThe Federal Crop Insurance Corporation Board approved the Post Application Coverage Endorsement recently, and the Risk Management Agency will share additional details later this year. The sales closing date for the endorsement will be the same as the producer's underlying corn policy. Visit rma.usda.gov for more information.\n\nSurvey reveals farmer sentiments\n\nAccording to a new Corteva Agriscience survey of 600-plus row-crop farmers across 26 U.S. states, soil-health practices continue to gain traction. Sixty-six percent of farmers report they have already implemented soil-health practices such as using cover crops and/or reduced tillage that would qualify them to enroll in most carbon programs.\n\nEven as soil-health practices become more widespread, farmer participation in carbon programs remains relatively low. While 72 percent of respondents are aware of carbon offerings, only three percent are enrolled in a carbon sequestration program. Many farmers indicate that they would consider a carbon program if the payout per acre reached $20; however, it isn't until the payout per acre would reach an estimated $40 that the majority said they would commit to participation in a program. A recent Purdue University study highlights that farmers need to be incentivized to adopt practices and join a carbon program.\n\nForty-four percent of farmers who have not already adopted those practices report increased interest in on-farm stewardship during the past five years. Lack of access to necessary equipment and services, as well as concern about return on investment, were cited as the biggest barriers to practice adoption.\n\nThe survey was conducted online within the United States by Trust in Food from June 4 to July 31. In total 617 U.S. row crop farmers in 26 states completed the survey. The online survey is not based on a probability sample, and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. Visit granular.ag/carbon-survey for more information.\n\nYield results accepted online\n\nThe National Corn Growers Association is accepting yield results of contest entries for the 2021 National Corn Yield Contest. All harvest results are due within two weeks after harvest or by Nov. 30, whichever is the earlier date. The contest winners will be announced Dec. 15. Harvest results can be entered online. Winners will receive national recognition in publications, such as the NCYC Corn Yield Guide, as well as other awards from participating sponsoring seed, chemical and crop-protection companies.

                "title": "Microsoft 365 Business Premium",
                "body": "Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the most feature-rich email hosting provider we've tested, which stands to reason seeing as how it's been around such a long time. The service makes domain and email setup easy for any sized business and has lots of migration and importing tools if you're coming from another platform.\n\nLocal and web versions of the full Microsoft Office suite are included, as well as access to Microsoft's more advanced tools like SharePoint and Intune for device management. You can also purchase a wide variety of add-on services, such as Microsoft 365 Business Voice, and these offerings are available from Microsoft or its large partner ecosystem. It may be more expensive, but for its feature list alone, it's an obvious Editors' Choice winner.\n\nThe service starts at $20 per user per month. That can add up quickly for larger organizations, but as mentioned its encyclopedic list of features makes the money worthwhile. Business Premium also has generous bedrock features at that price, which include 50GB of email hosting and 1TB of Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage in addition to domain hosting. That's an excellent overall list, though our other Editors' Choice pick, Google Workspace Business Standard, leads the pack with a whopping 2TB of mailbox storage.\n\nMore attractive to most businesses, especially in the new and distributed hybrid work model, is that you not only get the desktop, mobile, and web versions of the Microsoft Office 2019 suite but also the full version of Microsoft Teams plus team collaboration through SharePoint hosting. The bundled Intune app handles device management, so you'll be able to enforce hardware policies for home BYOD scenarios, which is something no other email hosting competitor offered.\n\nYou'll also get two forms of additional security. First is Microsoft Azure Information Protection (AIP). This is a content classification app that lets you tag documents with different classifications and assign varying levels of protection and access to them based on those tags. The second security measure is Microsoft Defender for 365. It's a 365-optimized version of the Microsoft Defender Security platform that provides antivirus and malware protection to data and endpoints. Microsoft hasn't pulled any punches, and you can try the service free for one month by visiting the company's website. For the money, the Business Premium tier will likely be the most popular purchase for most businesses.\n\nHowever, if all that is too rich or unnecessary for you, there are lower-cost options. A Microsoft 365 Business Basic edition is only $5 per user per month and includes Microsoft Teams, but relegates users to the web and mobile versions of the Office apps with no desktop versions included. The next cheapest is Microsoft 365 Apps, which will run you $8.25 per user per month but includes only the Office Premium apps (desktop and web) and OneDrive storage. Collaboration with Microsoft Teams and SharePoint is not part of this tier.\n\nFinally, the Microsoft 365 Business Standard tier should work for many smaller shops. This starts at $12.50 per user per month and includes everything in the Premium version except for Azure Information Protection, Defender, and Intune. While the prices are listed as per-user-per-month, all tiers require an annual commitment.\n\nCompared to our other Editors' Choice winner, Google Workspace Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is certainly more costly, especially since Google provides such massive mailbox storage for just $12 per user per month for its Standard tier. However, Google's bundled apps aren't nearly as comprehensive as Microsoft's, especially for data, user, and device management. It may cost more, but Microsoft 365 is still the more powerful platform.\n\nAs with any email hosting service, getting set up is often the hardest part. However, Microsoft has done a nice job of cutting through the traditionally cumbersome parts because it uses a guided setup process. It walks you through all of the major steps, such as downloading Office to every client, adding your domain name (including the option to migrate from another host), setting up Teams, and then enabling data loss prevention (DLP), which protects against anyone leaking your sensitive data. As a final step, you can configure protection for mobile app users by enabling data encryption and enforcing things such as re-authentication after a certain number of minutes.\n\nSince the copy of Office you install is already pre-linked with your account, there isn't much in the way of setup beyond running the installer and, on rare occasions, providing your log-in details. I really liked that you can do this for up to five devices per user. In today's world, it's not uncommon to have a desktop, laptop, and several mobile devices, so having a license that covers them all is not only convenient but saves money, too.\n\nManaging users is straightforward, too. Once you add a user, you'll be on the hook for an additional per-user-per-month charge, but beyond putting in some basic information and setting an initial password, there isn't much else to do.\n\nIf you need more granular control of your environment, as most larger businesses will, there's a handy admin center. This is where you'll fine-tune settings like threat management, mail flow rules, device policies, and similar IT chores. Another nice touch is that Microsoft 365 Business Premium already has standard best practices configured when it comes to security and user management. That means most small and midsized businesses (SMBs) can simply set up and go, knowing the service will cover their basic IT needs out of the box.\n\nIf you need more or something different, you can always change things in the admin center. While this part of the service is definitely intended for IT professionals, the admin center is very well organized. I could quickly find what I was looking for and access the appropriate management tools.\n\nWhile PCMag provides a deep dive on Microsoft 365's Office suite tools, an email hosting review wouldn't be complete without looking at email and collaboration tools. These are more important than ever now that we're all moving toward the new hybrid normal.\n\nCollaboration in Microsoft 365 Business Premium is essentially about Microsoft Office combined with Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. If you've used these apps separately, you'll love how they work together here. As far as the email client goes, the heart of the user experience is, of course, Microsoft Outlook.\n\nMost users have some experience with Outlook on the desktop, but with 365 Business, the really exciting stuff is happening in the web client. A recent addition, Microsoft Edit, is Microsoft's answer to Grammarly. It works across all the apps in the Office suite, but only on the web side. There's another handy feature that lets you quickly add files related to a conversation thread without having to go and search for the thread. Currently, this only works on OneDrive documents, but it's nice to have if you happen to be using the web client.\n\nIf we have a gripe with Microsoft 365, here it is: A web client should work across any browser, but Microsoft has really only focused on Windows and macOS. If you try and use a Microsoft 365 Office web app via a Linux browser, you'll almost certainly experience compatibility problems. Yes, the apps are usable overall, but you get a much smoother experience on the two commercial operating systems. Hopefully, this will change now that Microsoft is working to better integrate Linux with Windows.\n\nEven considering only the commercial operating systems, macOS is still noticeably behind Windows when it comes to how Outlook functions. Organization and advanced features are definitely lagging, which really shouldn't be the case anymore. Microsoft has also focused more on advancing its web version of Office than the desktop equivalents.\n\nFor example, aside from the Edit feature mentioned above, Redmond has made a very convenient change to the calendar. If you've had to schedule a video conference during the pandemic, you've probably had to do it for a larger number of people than usual, which means sifting through a long list of schedules until you find an open slot that works for everyone -- typically two or three months after you wanted to have the meeting. Outlook can now do that grunt work for you, using artificial intelligence (AI) to recommend times that will work best based on everyone's availability. If someone can't make it, there's a structured way to suggest alternate times. That's great, but it only works in the Outlook web client, not the desktop version.\n\nIntegration with Microsoft Teams is a given, but nevertheless important. There's a one-button option to add a Teams meeting to any meeting event. It's worth noting that invitees don't need to have the Teams client to attend, though that does give the best experience.\n\nSharePoint is another Microsoft 365 component that's probably underutilized by most customers because getting it up and running can be overwhelming. But if you need a centralized location to organize, plan, and collaborate on documents with change management enabled, this is the way to do it. It's also got task and workflow management, so it can be a little difficult to decide where to start, and you may need IT's help, but once you've got a plan for using SharePoint, other functionality will grow organically.\n\nMicrosoft does a good job with both security and privacy. Two-factor authentication is pervasive and there are a variety of data protection features beneath that. In the admin center, you can set up DLP policies that look at data and automatically classify what they recognize -- creating a rule, for example, that classifies a file as private whenever the DLP policy finds a Social Security number in it. You can also specify operations like auto-encrypting a document or restricting access and user rights.\n\nOn the email side, there's Microsoft 365 Message Encryption and Exchange Online Archiving. The former adds encryption and access rights to your emails so only the intended recipient is able to view them. It's included with Microsoft 365, but it'll work across Gmail and other email systems as well.\n\nExchange Online Archiving lets administrators set email archiving and retention policies. You can designate emails of a specific age to be automatically deleted or stored securely in the cloud, and you can do it based on content policies. For example, a healthcare organization could automatically delete most older emails, while securely archiving only those it needed to pass a future HIPAA audit. While no service is bulletproof when it comes to security, Microsoft puts up a great fight.\n\nThis all happens in the admin center, but this view offers more than just security. You'll come here to manage devices and add, delete, or modify user identities. There's also a nice dashboard right up front where the system will alert you to any problems or pressing needs associated with your account. Service downtime, a security issue, user problems, DLP queries -- it'll all be surfaced here along with the tools you'll need to address things. Finally, IT administrators that move around a lot can also get access to the admin center via a Microsoft 365 mobile app, available on both iOS and Android. The app provides instant visibility into any alert, though you'll need access to the full web admin app to address more complex problems.\n\nIf maintaining regulatory compliance is part of your job, know that Microsoft has data centers distributed across the U.S. and Northern Europe. All of them have undergone SOC auditing and achieved SOC 1 Type2, SOC 2, and SOC 3 compliance status. And if you've got a HIPPA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place, the service will cover HIPAA for you, too.\n\nThere's a much longer list of regulations that Microsoft 365 supports, but the more important news centers around the Compliance Manager. This is a workflow-oriented risk assessment tool that will help you manage all the nitty-gritty details of whatever regulation you need to support. Once you've set it up, that'll include things like data controls and retention, security policies, and audit trails, to name a few.\n\nCompliance Manager constantly scans those parameters and gives you an overall Compliance Score in your dashboard. Any problems are surfaced as alerts, and you can drill down into them for a detailed explanation and the Compliance Manager's recommendation for fixing it. This will be something of a bear to set up, but once you've got it running, it can drastically lighten your IT compliance load.\n\nMicrosoft used to win this category hands down, but Google Workspace and other email hosting players are catching up fast. Still, for the moment, we're giving Microsoft an edge here due to a partner system that's not only huge but very mature.\n\nSure, you'll find the usual names like Workspace, Slack, Trello, and Zapier on the list, but there's a whole library of other apps and integrations you can bolt-on for specific kinds of tasks, workloads, or vertical business needs. That library is so vast largely because Microsoft has traditionally pushed its development tools hard and made them available practically for free to anyone building Windows-compatible software. That created a happy developer base that even today few other companies can match.\n\nOverall, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the choice to beat in the email hosting category. Even with the big advances made by Google, Microsoft's offering still has significantly better features and its web-to-desktop experience is unrivaled. Its tools let you do everything from managing email to collaborating across teams using messaging, document sharing, and voice or video conferencing.\n\nEven strictly from an email hosting perspective, Microsoft 365 remains a leading contender. Setup, user importing and management, and a granular level of data security, loss prevention, and compliance management all come in a combination you just can't find elsewhere. Yes, it's more expensive than its rivals, but you really get what you pay for: an exceptionally well-rounded and secure end-to-end business productivity solution that's an easy pick for our Editors' Choice award.",

                "title": "THE NEW ORWELLIAN WORLD BASED ON CONTROL & SURVEILLANCE",
                "body": "I wrote about it many times, we can see it's progressing, but only in the so-called developed world. A dystopian society, which is doomed to fail, eventually. A world of surveillance, health-dictatorship, QR codes, cashless payments and for most people unlivable, it resembles the old systems like fascism or totalitarian communism, in a new outfit, which I will call a technocratic based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) totalitarian system, but all systems and ideologies that become totalitarian will fall, history has learned.\n\nA lot of evidence about the dystopian new society, based on so-called pandemic, or as I would call it a new technocratic dictatorial, including health, system has been put in place in many parts of the developed world, tests for this new worldwide including social credit system has been performed in Africa, as I wrote before experiments are conducted in Africa to implement this social credit system, based on a pandemic, with the cooperation of GAVI, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and with the World Economic Forum. They ironically call it a \"Wellnes-pass\", mind you in Africa, how utopian you can get! As we all know by now (I sincerely hope many are awake) it was never about a virus, but about control, smart cities, electrical cars, where Africa will be exploited again for Lithium, also Afghanistan, this is why the Western world had to withdraw, a geopolitical conflict is going on, not about Afghanistan as a territory, or pity the people, but about Lithium. Build Back Better, depopulation of the world, which Bill Gates and especially his father are experts in doing so are all part of the new dystopian world.\n\nEven the Catholic Church is involved in this great experiment, in Africa of course since many years, but also in the Western world, after years of child abuse and pedophilia scandals, they are just continuing with their unchristian policies. But we must not forget that the Catholic Church is an outgrowth of the Roman Empire, or as many these days call it the British Empire, basically it's the same, it's all about the Western unipolar ideology and colonialism with all their excesses. So the church, i.e. the Catholic, is involved in this dystopian new world, because they have a lot of money and have their own state called the Vatican. The Protestant church is not in this position and is now seen as an 'enemy' of the state, especially in the Netherlands. The Dutch government has now started their 'soft approach' to persecute the Protestants, a deja-vu is emerging about the times of the Huguenots, it is actually the descendants of these Huguenots, who will suffer the same fate again, now in the countries they had chosen centuries ago, to be free and where people are tolerant. In the Netherlands these Protestants will be forced into lockdowns, because many of them, on religious grounds, won't be vaccinated. Also, the Dutch government has started (with organizations) a research project, to establish if the Protestant church was involved into slavery in the Dutch East Indies. Of course they were, the whole of society was in these days, but the biggest criminals, just like now, are the rich, the elite and the Dutch royal family, who pretend to be Christian, but this Christianity is just a show, a performance for the ignorant citizens.\n\nThe Dutch parliament rejected a motion that various parties, including Forum for Democracy (FVD) submitted against the introduction of a social credit system in the Netherlands, the government can now legally introduce the social credit system, which they have already started, of course, by introducing the so-called QR Corona pass. The next step is the Co2 level and the measurement of eating meat and eventually censor the Internet, by introducing a digital pass, put on your existing pass to use the internet. The European Union (EU) Social Credit System will me much worse than the Chinese experiment, which was only conducted in a few cities. The EU social credit system is about total control, about your body, your behaviour, your private life and eventually about your physical life, when you don't comply, there will be no mercy and no help, your life will be like a wanderer, without any benefits or life as you used to know it, be prepared.\n\nIn other parts of the Western world, like in Australia, the dystopian society has become reality already. Australia with its past and present and being part of the British Empire (BE) and under the influence of the US, preparing for a conflict with China, Australia is closest to China and we all know their new \"AUKUS\" a new so-called security pact between The UK, US and Australia, in what's seen as an effort to counter China. To be prepared and outsmart China, they already started with their draconian social credit system and moreover and most worse their surveillance state has become reality, alarming reports come out of the country which was once called the land of the free is now the most repressive country in the Western world and I wonder where Amnesty International or Human Right are? Of course, they will not report, they are a tool from the same Western world, reporting only about non-complying countries like Russia, Syria or the underdeveloped countries. But Australia was always a 'racist' country built on the principles of murdering the Aboriginals and sending criminals to their conquered land. Canada is another example, in a different way than Australia but withe the same ideology. Of course, the uttermost worst country is the so-called democracy of Israel, where life is \"hell\" for most citizens, it was already worse for Palestinians, but now especially for the Orthodox Jews.\n\nConclusion\n\nI would like to write a conclusion, but can we make a conclusion? I guess not, the world as we are experiencing it today, is unstable, full of conflict and polarization, with many geopolitical differences. I am afraid we are back, like the roaring twenties of the last century resulting in the grim thirties, unemployment, the introduction (by force) of a new system, designed by the elite of the Western world. Like now It's ripe for conflict and most likely war, not like WWII but a different war, biological warfare (maybe we are already experiencing this), depopulation agenda, implemented by vaccinations and biological warfare and the introduction of AI. Eugenics (not new) is necessary according to the elite, like in the two world wars were eugenics happened through killing of soldiers on the battlefield and of course the holocaust. Now according to the elite there are too many mouths to feed and no jobs (AI) and of course the elite will not share their money with the poor. A dark time in human history has come again.",

                "title": "THE NEW ORWELLIAN WORLD BASED ON CONTROL & SURVEILLANCE",
                "body": "I wrote about it many times, we can see it's progressing, but only in the so-called developed world. A dystopian society, which is doomed to fail, eventually. A world of surveillance, health-dictatorship, QR codes, cashless payments and for most people unlivable, it resembles the old systems like fascism or totalitarian communism, in a new outfit, which I will call a technocratic based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) totalitarian system, but all systems and ideologies that become totalitarian will fall, history has learned.\n\nA lot of evidence about the dystopian new society, based on so-called pandemic, or as I would call it a new technocratic dictatorial, including health, system has been put in place in many parts of the developed world, tests for this new worldwide including social credit system has been performed in Africa, as I wrote before experiments are conducted in Africa to implement this social credit system, based on a pandemic, with the cooperation of GAVI, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and with the World Economic Forum. They ironically call it a \"Wellnes-pass\", mind you in Africa, how utopian you can get! As we all know by now (I sincerely hope many are awake) it was never about a virus, but about control, smart cities, electrical cars, where Africa will be exploited again for Lithium, also Afghanistan, this is why the Western world had to withdraw, a geopolitical conflict is going on, not about Afghanistan as a territory, or pity the people, but about Lithium. Build Back Better, depopulation of the world, which Bill Gates and especially his father are experts in doing so are all part of the new dystopian world.\n\nEven the Catholic Church is involved in this great experiment, in Africa of course since many years, but also in the Western world, after years of child abuse and pedophilia scandals, they are just continuing with their unchristian policies. But we must not forget that the Catholic Church is an outgrowth of the Roman Empire, or as many these days call it the British Empire, basically it's the same, it's all about the Western unipolar ideology and colonialism with all their excesses. So the church, i.e. the Catholic, is involved in this dystopian new world, because they have a lot of money and have their own state called the Vatican. The Protestant church is not in this position and is now seen as an 'enemy' of the state, especially in the Netherlands. The Dutch government has now started their 'soft approach' to persecute the Protestants, a deja-vu is emerging about the times of the Huguenots, it is actually the descendants of these Huguenots, who will suffer the same fate again, now in the countries they had chosen centuries ago, to be free and where people are tolerant. In the Netherlands these Protestants will be forced into lockdowns, because many of them, on religious grounds, won't be vaccinated. Also, the Dutch government has started (with organizations) a research project, to establish if the Protestant church was involved into slavery in the Dutch East Indies. Of course they were, the whole of society was in these days, but the biggest criminals, just like now, are the rich, the elite and the Dutch royal family, who pretend to be Christian, but this Christianity is just a show, a performance for the ignorant citizens.\n\nThe Dutch parliament rejected a motion that various parties, including Forum for Democracy (FVD) submitted against the introduction of a social credit system in the Netherlands, the government can now legally introduce the social credit system, which they have already started, of course, by introducing the so-called QR Corona pass. The next step is the Co2 level and the measurement of eating meat and eventually censor the Internet, by introducing a digital pass, put on your existing pass to use the internet. The European Union (EU) Social Credit System will me much worse than the Chinese experiment, which was only conducted in a few cities. The EU social credit system is about total control, about your body, your behaviour, your private life and eventually about your physical life, when you don't comply, there will be no mercy and no help, your life will be like a wanderer, without any benefits or life as you used to know it, be prepared.\n\nIn other parts of the Western world, like in Australia, the dystopian society has become reality already. Australia with its past and present and being part of the British Empire (BE) and under the influence of the US, preparing for a conflict with China, Australia is closest to China and we all know their new \"AUKUS\" a new so-called security pact between The UK, US and Australia, in what's seen as an effort to counter China. To be prepared and outsmart China, they already started with their draconian social credit system and moreover and most worse their surveillance state has become reality, alarming reports come out of the country which was once called the land of the free is now the most repressive country in the Western world and I wonder where Amnesty International or Human Right are? Of course, they will not report, they are a tool from the same Western world, reporting only about non-complying countries like Russia, Syria or the underdeveloped countries. But Australia was always a 'racist' country built on the principles of murdering the Aboriginals and sending criminals to their conquered land. Canada is another example, in a different way than Australia but withe the same ideology. Of course, the uttermost worst country is the so-called democracy of Israel, where life is \"hell\" for most citizens, it was already worse for Palestinians, but now especially for the Orthodox Jews.\n\nConclusion\n\nI would like to write a conclusion, but can we make a conclusion? I guess not, the world as we are experiencing it today, is unstable, full of conflict and polarization, with many geopolitical differences. I am afraid we are back, like the roaring twenties of the last century resulting in the grim thirties, unemployment, the introduction (by force) of a new system, designed by the elite of the Western world. Like now It's ripe for conflict and most likely war, not like WWII but a different war, biological warfare (maybe we are already experiencing this), depopulation agenda, implemented by vaccinations and biological warfare and the introduction of AI. Eugenics (not new) is necessary according to the elite, like in the two world wars were eugenics happened through killing of soldiers on the battlefield and of course the holocaust. Now according to the elite there are too many mouths to feed and no jobs (AI) and of course the elite will not share their money with the poor. A dark time in human history has come again.",

                "body": "This translation has been automatically generated and has not been verified for accuracy. Full Disclaimer\n\nBeverly Morrison loves to drive - the larger the vehicle, the better - and for nearly 30 years, she's made it her career. Ms. Morrison started piloting a Greyhound bus when she was 24, and spent time in the U.S. military, where she drove trucks. But it was big rigs she really fell in love with. She hauled gasoline from refineries to fuel stations around California, and later delivered to outposts in Nevada, Oregon, Idaho and Washington State.\n\nMs. Morrison became accustomed to long, solitary journeys. \"I love being alone,\" she says, adding that's why she stopped driving buses and switched to trucks. \"I just wanted to be alone in the vehicle.\" To pass the time, she listened to National Public Radio and devoured audio books in 10-hour stretches. She found something exhilarating in manoeuvring such massive objects through physical space. \"It's in my blood,\" she says. \"That's the best way I can describe it.\"\n\nShe's not doing much driving any more, at least not in the traditional sense. Ms. Morrison works as a safety driver for Embark Trucks Inc., a San Francisco startup developing autonomous long-haul rigs. She sits in the bright blue cab, foot poised over the pedal, hands at the wheel, while the truck handles steering, braking, acceleration and staying in its lane. Ms. Morrison drives on public highways and on a test track outside the Bay Area, taking over the controls when necessary, such as when other drivers are behaving erratically. (Embark does not disclose how often its safety drivers intervene.)\n\nAn outsider might think there's something strange or even demoralizing for a lifelong trucker to just sit there. But there isn't, Ms. Morrison says. She emphasizes she always has control. \"That's why it's not quite as scary as it sounds,\" she says. By taking the truck out into the world, she is effectively teaching its electronic brain to become smarter, so that someday soon it can handle itself with no one at the wheel.\n\nHere's where the job seems to turn from unusual to comically dystopian. Isn't she training the very technology that could put her and countless others out of work? Again, that's not how she sees it. Ms. Morrison took the job with Embark because she says she believes it has the potential to make trucking safer and more efficient. \"To be able to keep driving a truck, and work on this technology, is the best thing in the world to me,\" she says.\n\nThe developers behind that technology are two Canadians, Alex Rodrigues and Brandon Moak, Embark's chief executive and chief technology officer, respectively. Both dropped out of the University of Waterloo, moved to California and founded the company in 2016 to reimagine the US$700-billion trucking industry. Their test vehicles have since accumulated more than one million miles of autonomous road time (with safety drivers), and the company, which will list on the Nasdaq this year, is piloting deliveries for a handful of partners. By 2024, it plans to run autonomous trucks commercially in the southern U.S. and start expanding to the rest of the country two years later. (That requires dealing with snow, a capability Embark's trucks do not have.)\n\nThe two of them still have thorny technical hurdles to overcome. \"They're tough enough that nobody has really tried to tackle them yet,\" says Mr. Rodrigues, \"but it's something Embark feels pretty confident about.\" Technology isn't the only roadblock, either: Regulators, insurance companies and carriers have to be onboard, too.\n\nThe autonomous driving field is replete with bold claims and unrealized promises, as developing vehicles that can safely navigate streets without human intervention has proved to be far more difficult than initially believed. Uber threw gobs of money at self-driving taxis, but sold the division last year in defeat. Long-haul trucking, though, involves long stretches of monotonous highway and is generally thought to be more manageable. There's a business case, too, as the technology could drive down costs and alleviate a chronic shortage of drivers.\n\nInvestors are now pouring billions of dollars into automated trucking startups, and Embark is one of a handful of players striving to bring the technology to market in the next two or three years. The message, both from investors and trucking startups, is that after years of false starts, autonomous driving is finally near at hand. Embark's valuation is a testament to that hope: US$5.2-billion, despite no revenue, substantial losses and an unproven business model.\n\nFor anyone to make money with self-driving trucks in the next few years would be a huge achievement, but all the more so for Mr. Rodrigues and Mr. Moak: the former is only 25, and the latter only recently turned 26. What they've built so far has amazed Ms. Morrison, the safety driver. She gives demos to employees and job candidates, and hears a common refrain: \"It's so human.\"\n\nEmbark maintains a fleet of about 20 trucks, each customized with multiple lidar devices, cameras and GPS antennas. Today, Embark pilots its trucks along Interstate 10 between Los Angeles and Phoenix, a roughly 600-kilometre journey one-way. As the truck drives, the artificial intelligence underlying its operations runs through 1,200 scenarios a second, planning moves up to one minute in advance, navigating construction, lane closures and other situations in real time.\n\nThe industry is intensely competitive, and Mr. Rodrigues is more than ready to rhapsodize about what he says is Embark's superior technology. He also emphasizes Embark has been focused on trucks for longer than its competitors, some of whom first started working on cars. Even so, Waymo, which is owned by Google parent Alphabet, started developing autonomous vehicle technology back in 2009. In some respects, Embark is an underdog; competitors such as TuSimple and Aurora (also co-founded by a Canadian) are worth billions more today.\n\nStill, Mr. Rodrigues is adamant Embark's singular focus on trucking is an advantage. The company has no plans to build vehicles itself, but is instead developing a self-driving software platform compatible with four of the biggest truck manufacturers in the U.S. \"It allows us to be far more scalable,\" Mr. Rodrigues says. Embark will then charge carriers using its software on a per-mile basis.\n\nUnder Embark's model, which some competitors are pursuing as well, autonomous and human drivers will work together. Self-driving trucks will traverse the highways while people handle the more complicated urban portions of a delivery. Mr. Rodrigues first foresees a human driver picking up cargo from a factory or distribution centre and taking it to a transfer hub. There, the cargo would be switched to an autonomous Embark truck, which would then drive itself to a highway and complete the longest portion of the journey, ending at a different transfer hub close to the final destination. Another human driver would pick up the load to finish the last leg.\n\nIt's an approach the company says will save money and improve safety without decimating employment. \"You end up with there being more jobs and more drivers that work locally within a given city,\" Mr. Rodrigues says, speaking over Zoom from his parents' place in Kelowna, B.C., where he was visiting. At 25, sporting a button-down shirt, he looks like he just bounded out of his first Engineering 101 class, but he fields questions like a seasoned executive. He has a few well-honed lines, deftly bats away skepticism, and perks up when asked a question he hasn't had to answer before. In interviews, he has noted he's spent some 15 years building robots - which is confusing until you realize he's counting from the time he was 11.\n\nHe grew up in Calgary, and his dad, Claudio, started his own company based on a very low-tech concept: grocery store checkout dividers that contained advertising inserts. He and his wife, Jill, patented the device, which they dubbed the AdBar. As a kid, he watched his mom and some friends slip ads into the dividers and deliver them to grocery stores. The company has since expanded into other advertising and marketing services, and Jill served as executive vice-president until recently. She now runs a small business selling anti-fog face masks.\n\nMr. Rodrigues was a precocious kid who kept a journal for business ideas, which he and his father discussed in lieu of bedtime stories. Claudio would prod his son with questions about cost structures and staffing needs. \"They weren't the most realistic business plans,\" Mr. Rodrigues says, \"but they weren't the worst.\" (His sister, meanwhile, attends medical school.)\n\nHe found his calling in seventh grade, when he joined his school's competitive robotics team. Each year, teams are challenged with constructing a robot to perform certain tasks, such as shooting basketballs. Mr. Rodrigues has a competitive streak (he also joined the debate team) and took these tournaments very seriously. The next year, his team won a world championship, and two years later, he opted to attend a different high school than his friends just to join its robotics crew. He was unimpressed with his teammates, though. \"They just didn't have the desire to be great,\" he says flatly. So he changed schools, instituted its first robotics team, and carried it to the world finals.\n\nMr. Rodrigues brightens when talking about the robots he used to build. During our Zoom interview, he shares a video of a boxy red robot the size of a dishwasher stacking crates, built by a team he was mentoring at the time. The competitions taught him how to focus and winnow down a problem into something manageable. \"When we built something super complicated, we got destroyed,\" he says. \"It doesn't matter how good you are at this, you need to pick something with a narrow scope.\"\n\nAfter graduation, he enrolled in mechatronics engineering at the University of Waterloo in 2013, a demanding program that involves robotics, machine learning and computer science. While there, he got to know another mechatronics student named Michael Skupien. They'd actually met before, during a high-school robotics match; their teams joined forces to win a regional competition. At the time, tech companies were investing heavily in autonomous driving, and the two students, brimming with youthful confidence, wondered if they could do it, too.\n\nThey slapped together a small contraption with Lego and a cheap motion sensor, which did little more than navigate by following red objects. They decided to try something more ambitious and purchased a used golf cart online, working various connections to procure equipment. Outwardly, they presented the idea as a business venture, but in reality, they simply thought it was cool.\n\nThe summer of 2015, they assembled the first version in the garage of Mr. Rodrigues's parents' home in Calgary, programming it to follow a particular route. Usually, someone sat inside as a safety measure, but once Mr. Rodrigues stepped out and watched in awe as the golf cart circled around a field, completely unmanned. There was no way to stop it remotely. \"The plan was, like, I was just going to run after it,\" he says.\n\nWhen they returned to university, they recruited Brandon Moak, another mechatronics student, hailing from Nova Scotia, who took over programming efforts. (They had already consulted him on some tech questions over the summer.) All three were part of a university-backed incubator called Velocity, having enrolled during their first year. Velocity typically admitted older students, but made an exception. \"They were just very mature, very focused and very friendly, and checked every box that we would want,\" says Nancy Heide, who handled admissions at the time. Mr. Rodrigues struck her as a natural leader, who combined a technical mind with an outgoing personality. \"He also just got away with things,\" she says.\n\nThe crew, for example, needed somewhere to store their golf cart. So they erected a tent next to the Velocity building and parked it there without bothering to ask for permission. (Mr. Moak recalls they at least alerted a facilities manager.) The golf cart became a novel marketing tool for the university. \"The president loved putting people in that thing and driving them around,\" says Mike Kirkup, Velocity's former director. He also recalls how confident the three of them were about the future of autonomous driving. \"To them, this was so obvious,\" he says. \"Like, 'I don't understand why all of you are living in the past.' \"\n\nIn 2016, they paused their studies and decamped to the Y Combinator incubator in San Francisco. By then, they'd incorporated a company called Varden Labs and planned to build autonomous shuttles to ferry students around college campuses. They had a few pilot projects, but it was soon obvious the business was a dud. Students had no trouble getting to class on foot, for one thing. They considered pivoting to mining vehicles and delivery robots, but settled on trucking. Mr. Rodrigues had already fielded calls from curious transportation companies.\n\nHe also heard from the administration at Waterloo, who wanted to know when he would return to finish his degree. Mr. Rodrigues always told them he wasn't coming back. One time, an official gave him an ultimatum and Mr. Rodrigues brushed it off, explaining he had eight employees under his watch. The official switched gears and offered him the chance to return next semester. \"I was like, 'I don't think you heard me right.' \"\n\nThat single-minded focus helps explain how, after leaving golf carts behind, Mr. Rodrigues and his small team turned Embark into a billion-dollar enterprise. They started working out of an old bicycle repair shop, and their first task was to reverse engineer a long-haul truck to take control of its steering, acceleration and braking capabilities. \"That's one of the more complex tasks that people don't necessarily think about,\" Mr. Moak says. \"How do you control this system for the first time? We didn't know if we could.\"\n\nThe process took a couple of months, and the team first tested the semi-truck at a decommissioned airstrip. Mr. Skupien punched some buttons on a keyboard and watched the truck lurch forward. \"It was pretty surreal, especially when this thing is barrelling at 120 kilometres per hour,\" he says. It was the first of many milestones for Embark, but one of Mr. Skupien's last acts at the company. He left Embark in 2017 and returned to Canada. Neither he nor the company can comment on his departure. All he allows is that he no longer considers Mr. Rodrigues and Mr. Moak friends.\n\nSince then, Embark has steadily hit its milestones, honing its technology, raising money and building connections with trucking companies. But if it is to run autonomous vehicles on highways in 2024, Embark has a lot more to do. First, there are five capabilities Embark needs to develop and perfect, such as making emergency stops, evasive manoeuvres, and dealing with law enforcement, inspectors and mechanical failures - problems nobody has yet to crack. They're not just tech issues, either, Mr. Moak points out. Conducting inspections on autonomous vehicles, for example, requires working with regulators to rethink the process.\n\nTackling those issues also requires funding, which is why Embark earlier retained investment bankers to explore options. Last March, those bankers contacted Ian Robertson in Oakville, Ont., the co-founder of Algonquin Power and Utilities, which he and his partner built into a $12-billion business over three decades. He left last year to dive into the world of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), publicly traded blank-cheque firms. Under the banner of Northern Genesis, Mr. Robertson and his partners first backed Lion Electric, a Canadian manufacturer of zero-emission commercial vehicles.\n\nMr. Robertson was agnostic when pitched on Embark, especially because it had zero revenue. \"Generally, that was a no-go from my perspective,\" he says. But like Mr. Rodrigues, he saw autonomous driving as inevitable.\n\nEarly in the talks, he arranged a trip to San Francisco. COVID-19 restrictions were still in place at the border, so Mr. Robertson, who has a pilot's licence, flew himself south. He met with Mr. Rodrigues and climbed into an Embark truck. \"It's a weird thing to say about a computer, but there was a thoughtfulness about its driving,\" Mr. Robertson says. The truck accelerated to allow a car in behind it and smoothly moved over when it came upon a temporary lane closing. When Mr. Robertson finished his ride an hour and a half later, he was convinced the technology was real and not that far off.\n\nIn June, Embark announced a merger with a Northern Genesis SPAC, which is slated to close this fall. The deal gives Embark access to more than US$600-million in cash, and includes investment from Tiger Global Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Mr. Rodrigues will retain 39.6 per cent of the voting power, while Mr. Moak will have 29.3 per cent. The additional capital sets up Embark to achieve its goals, Mr. Robertson says, but he sounds a note of caution: \"It's a pre-revenue story, and we can't lose sight of that.\"\n\nEmbark lost nearly $37-million in the past two calendar years, plus another $29-million in the first half of 2021. But it anticipates making money very rapidly. In 2024, Embark projects it will bring in US$867-million in revenue and turn a profit of US$584-million - a 67-per-cent margin. Embark's estimates leave zero room for error, says Richard Windsor, founder of Radio Free Mobile, a technology research firm. \"It's priced to perfection,\" he says. \"If they make those numbers, I can get behind a $5-billion valuation. But it's asking an awful lot to pay up for it at that price now.\"\n\nTalking to Mr. Rodrigues, it's easy to become convinced he really will have autonomous trucks on the highways in 2024. He's so breezily certain, so measured in his approach, so accomplished at a young age that surely he'll pull it off, right?\n\n\"Overly optimistic,\" is the blunt assessment of Missy Cummings, a professor and director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University. Machine-learning systems lack top-down reasoning, she says, meaning they can't adequately decipher contextual clues to make sense of the world. Such systems can be flummoxed by tree branches obscuring road signs and have been unable to recognize familiar objects in unfamiliar poses, such as a motorcycle lying on the road.\n\nThe solution engineers have proposed is simply to feed AI systems more data. \"It begs the question as to how much of this finger-in-the-dyke engineering is practical or possible?\" Prof. Cummings wrote in a paper. Already, Tesla drivers have been killed while using that company's driving assist feature, and a self-driving Uber killed a pedestrian in Arizona in 2018, even with a safety driver onboard. While highway driving might be less complex than navigating congested downtown streets, tractor trailers are huge objects that can do catastrophic damage. Prof. Cummings also faults autonomous vehicle developers for not disclosing detailed safety and hazard analyses reports. \"Until we can see those kinds of data, no one can have any certainty about whether these vehicles are safe,\" she says.\n\nA U.S. Department of Transportation database shows Embark trucks have not been involved in any collisions, and the company says it has not even experienced a minor accident. Safety drivers have been present at all times, though, so record doesn't provide much indication of how the truck will perform with no driver at all. (The company will only start testing with no safety drivers in 2023.) Embark maintains trucking is simply an easier problem to tackle and thus achievable. \"We have this opportunity to pick the routes that we understand to be good from a construction, weather pattern and traffic perspective,\" Mr. Moak says. \"You don't need this higher-level order of reasoning, just because the environment itself ends up being inherently simpler.\" Still, unpredictable events can happen on highways, he acknowledges. \"Again, it's a game of what is feasible. What is the frequency of these things?\"\n\nSuccess also depends on how quickly carriers adopt autonomous vehicles. Embark, like its peers, is selling its technology as a way to deal with labour shortages and save money. (Autonomous drivers never sleep, of course.) Embark estimates it can save carriers 80 cents a mile, allowing customers to nearly double their profit margins. It's already running pilot projects to transport cargo between Los Angeles and Phoenix for a variety of companies, including HP Inc. and Werner Enterprises, a US$3-billion transportation company headquartered in Nebraska.\n\nCarriers are interested, but generally in no rush. Chad Dittberner, a senior vice-president at Werner, says the company would only use such vehicles if they are proven to be safer than a human driver. \"There's going to have to be miles put on the roadways,\" he says, \"and we're talking lots of miles.\" The rate of industry adoption will be gradual, he adds, in part because the lifespan of a long-haul truck is around nine years. \"Do I think there's a light switch in 2025 or 2026 and all trucks being purchased go to autonomous?\" he says. \"No, that's not going to happen.\"\n\nAutomation also brings long-term consequences. Embark describes the implications in almost utopian terms: cost savings, safer roads and jobs for truckers. Even as long-haul routes are automated, drivers will be needed for short routes, it claims. During our interview, Mr. Rodrigues pointed to a recent study funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation that found autonomous trucks could increase annual earnings for all workers by at least US$203 a year through productivity improvements and that long-haul drivers would not suffer mass layoffs.\n\nOthers aren't so sanguine. Steve Viscelli, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has extensively studied trucking, estimates some 294,000 long-haul jobs are at risk in the U.S., including some of the highest-paying positions in the industry. Any short-haul jobs created as a result of increased demand are likely to be far worse than those that are lost, he says. Short-haul drivers already deal with low wages and long periods of unpaid waiting. Absent public-policy intervention, Prof. Viscelli says, there is little reason to believe conditions will improve. \"We have essentially 40 years of history that tell us that new technology in truck driving makes jobs worse,\" he says. \"The burden of proof is definitely on the developers to show why this particular technology is going to do something completely different.\"\n\nEmbark's own filings note the unpredictability of the endeavour. \"There is, therefore, substantial uncertainty as to whether Embark's business plan will prove successful,\" reads the company's 40-page risk section. \"I'm not going to reply directly to that,\" Mr. Rodrigues says when asked about it. \"Embark has a track record of being very successful at delivering this technology and being a leader - if not the leader - at hitting these milestones. At the same time, this is a thing no one has ever done before.\"\n\nIt's hard to fault Mr. Rodrigues for such boundless confidence. After all, his story so far is one of success after success, from building a rudimentary self-driving Lego vehicle to helming a multibillion-dollar autonomous trucking firm, all before turning 30. Rather than be discouraged by the enormous task that remains, he and Mr. Moak have already seen the arc technology follows. Something that once seemed like science fiction quickly becomes mundane. Back when they were shuttling students around campuses, the passengers were initially amazed the see a vehicle drive itself. After a few minutes, their heads were bowed, lost to their smartphones, like it was just another ride.",

                "body": "Three brands that have stood the test of time command the highest dollar in the luxury resale market.\n\nHermès, Chanel, and Louis Vuitton continue to have the best resale value, according to the Clair Report from luxury resale retailer Rebag. The historic legacies of the three brands play a role in their value, along with their control over pricing and inventory, the report said.\n\nHermès handbags topped the list, retaining an average of 90% of their retail value. Louis Vuitton followed with 80%, gaining 17 percentage points over last year. Chanel handbags kept 75% of their value on average, climbing 12 percentage points from 2020.\n\nThe data in the Clair report was retrieved from Rebag's artificial intelligence-powered instant pricing tool. Clair. Founded online in 2014, Rebag currently has seven physical stores, including four locations in New York City. In August, it opened a location in Greenwich, Conn., featuring a self-service kiosk that allows customers to receive an instant price quote.\n\n[Read More: Rebag's new Connecticut store has item-pricing self-service kiosk]\n\nOn the jewelry front, Van Cleef & Arpels, Rolex, and Cartier stand at the top of the resale value chart. Van Cleef & Arpels pieces retain an average value of 95% of their retail value, while Rolex timepieces currently retain 82% of their retail price. Watches and fine jewelry by Cartier averaged 74% of their retail value on the resale market\n\nAccording to the report, with several brands strategically raising prices and restricting their supply, the appetite for luxury resale is rising.\n\nAs to what's ahead in the luxury resale market, the report predicted that Tiffany & Co.'s retention value will increase next year due to a few factors, including changes in leadership, shift in target demographics and the appointment of new brand ambassadors. Also, watches will continue to climb on the secondary market. With luxury watch intricately handcrafted in Switzerland, it's nearly impossible for watchmakers to create the supply to meet the demand, according to the report.",

Pronouns: He/him Tristan covers human-centric artificial intelligence advances, politics, queer stuff, cannabis, and gaming. Pronouns: He/him\n\nNicolas Chaillan, the Pentagon's former Chief Software Officer, is on a whirlwind press tour to drum up as much fervor for his radical assertion that the US has already lost the AI race against China.\n\nSpeaking to the Financial Times in his first interview after leaving his post at the Pentagon, Chaillan said:\n\nWe have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years. Right now, it's already a done deal.\n\nChaillan's departure from the Pentagon was preceded by a \"blistering letter\" where he signaled he was quitting out of frustration over the government's inability to properly implement cybersecurity and artificial intelligence technologies.\n\nAnd, now, he's telling anyone who will listen that the US has already lost a war to China that hasn't even happened yet. He's essentially saying that the US is a sitting duck who's safety and sanctity is predicated on the fact that China is choosing not to attack and destroy us.\n\nAnd, let's be clear, Chaillan's not talking about a hot war. Per the FT article, he said \"whether it takes some kind of war or not is anecdotal.\"\n\nThe score: It doesn't matter how you measure things, the US is not losing the AI race to China.\n\nAmong China's top AI companies you'll find Baidu, a business with about a $55B market cap.\n\nLet's put that into perspective. Google is worth over a trillion dollars. That's 18 times more than Baidu. And that's just Google. Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft are also worth a trillion and they're all AI companies as well.\n\nThere is no measure, including talent draw and laboratory size, by which you could say China is even in the same class when it comes to AI companies.\n\nAnd when it comes to AI research coming out of universities, the US again leads the world by a grand margin.\n\nNot only does the US attract students from all over the world, but it also houses some of the world's most advanced AI programs at the university level. Between the cognitive research done at places like NYU and Harvard and the machine learning applications for engineering being invented at MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and their ilk, it's incredibly difficult to make an argument that China's academic research outclasses the US'.\n\nThat's not to denigrate the amazing work being done by researchers in China, but there's certainly no reason to believe China's going to overtake the West in a matter of time by sheer virtue of its academia.\n\nAnd that just leaves public-sector and military AI. What's interesting about China is that, nationally, its government gives far more support for AI research than any other nation.\n\nMany experts feel that China's massive investments in public sector research combined with its authoritarian approach to controlling what the public sector and academia do, could lead to a situation where China leapfrogs the US.\n\nThis, however, is conjecture. The reality is that US companies don't need government investments. Unlike the US government, Amazon isn't in massive debt to its shareholders. Amazon is one of the most profitable enterprises in the history of humanity.\n\nAnd there's no law saying Amazon must work with the US government. It's free to continue making money hand over fist and pushing the philosophical limits on what wealth is or how economies work whether it chooses to play ball with the Pentagon or not.\n\nThe point is this: In China, all research is military research.\n\nThe FT article makes it apparent that Chaillan's real problem is with democracy:\n\nHe also blamed the reluctance of Google to work with the US defence department on AI, and extensive debates over AI ethics for slowing the US down. By contrast, he said Chinese companies are obliged to work with Beijing, and were making \"massive investment\" into AI without regard to ethics.\n\nIn some weird \"give up your freedoms for the greater good way\" his words might make sense. Except for one thing: the one major player in the global AI game that we haven't spoken about yet is the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, more commonly referred to by its acronym DARPA.\n\nDARPA is the US government's version of the laboratory Q leads in the James Bond universe. It's always looking for technologies - literally any technologies, no matter how strange or unlikely - to exploit for military use.\n\nBut there's nothing fictional about DARPA or its work. Either DARPA or a DARPA-adjacent agency of similar reform is at the financial heart of thousands upon thousands of university studies and technology projects in the US every year.\n\nFor perspective: DARPA literally invented the internet, GPS, and the graphical user-interface.\n\nI mention all of this to point out that there is no domain by which you can say the US is not leading the world in AI. I'm not saying that as a patriot (disclosure: I'm a US citizen who lives abroad and a US Navy veteran). I'm saying it because it's demonstrably true.\n\nIn fairness, Chaillan's clarified his words since the FT article. On LinkedIn he wrote:\n\nFor those who saw this article, I want to clarify one thing. I never said we lost. I said as it stands and if we don't wake up NOW we have no fighting chance to win against China in 15 years. I also said that they're leading in AI and Cyber NOW. Not in 10 years as some reports mention.\n\nOf course 750 pages government funded reports always tell us we have more time than we have so no one is held accountable for missing the already past due target.\n\nThose are just common sense fact. We are competing against 1.5B folks here. Either we are smarter and more agile or we lose. Period.\n\nNever let the truth get in the way of a good story eh? Per the FT article:\n\nWe have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years. Right now, it's already a done deal; it is already over in my opinion,\" he said, adding there was \"good reason to be angry\".\n\nThe bottom line is that Chaillan's spreading propaganda. He's employing a centuries-old racist trope called the \"China Bogeyman.\" The US has used it for decades to justify its bloated defense budget to the public.\n\nThe idea is that US citizens should be scared of China not because of its academic, economic, or military technologies. But because of the sheer fact that there are 1.5 billion people in that country who aren't Americans.\n\nChaillan's using the China Bogeyman and his former positions as an IT boss for the Air Force and the Pentagon as a political tool. Whether his goal is to run for office or a to get a lofty consulting position at a conservative-leaning organization, it's clear what the purpose of Chaillan's outlandish statements are: to pressure the public into believing their safety relies on doing whatever it takes to ward off the imminent threat posed by the mere existence of 1.5 billion people in China.\n\nIt's a baseless argument against the development of ethical AI and policies restricting the US from creating and using harmful AI technologies.",

                "body": "In Phase 1, myLanguage will adapt its voice translation technologies for use in a rugged, hand-held mobile device.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) has awarded myLanguage of San Jose, CA, $199,592 in Phase 1 funding to adapt and customize its language translation platform to support the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\n\"We look forward to working with myLanguage as they develop language translation solutions to enhance safe and efficient USCG missions,\" said Wendy Chaves, Chief of Coast Guard Research, Development, Test & Evaluation and Innovation.\n\nCoast Guard operators must be able to communicate with vessel occupants - many who may be non-English speakers - while performing a variety of rescue and investigation missions. Accurate and swift translation of information is critical to the safety and security of USCG boarding teams and vessel occupants. S&T's Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) Language Translator solicitation sought new capabilities to support the Coast Guard in facilitating real-time communication with non-English speakers and those who are unable to communicate verbally. The solicitation also included requirements for the language translation technology to be capable of operating both online and offline because many USCG interactions take place in extreme environmental conditions in locations without cell service or internet connection.\n\nThe current myLanguage platform is an online and offline voice-to-text speech recognition and text-to-text translation system that employs deep learning and artificial intelligence. In Phase 1, myLanguage will adapt its voice translation technologies for use in a rugged, hand-held mobile device that can withstand extreme temperatures and is able to customize model designs and training language models to fit USCG use cases.\n\n\"The focus of the myLanguage technologies is to enable fluent conversations across language barriers,\" said Melissa Oh, SVIP Managing Director. \"This Phase 1 funding enables myLanguage to expand their product capabilities for commercialization and provide USCG with an innovative technology that strengthens operator safety and mission outcomes.\"\n\nAbout SVIP\n\nSVIP is one of S&T's programs and tools to fund innovation and collaborate with the private sector to advance homeland security solutions. Companies participating in SVIP are eligible for up to $2 million of non-dilutive funding over four phases to develop and adapt commercial technologies for homeland security use cases.",

                "body": "Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the most feature-rich email hosting provider we've tested, which stands to reason seeing as how it's been around such a long time. The service makes domain and email setup easy for any sized business and has lots of migration and importing tools if you're coming from another platform.\n\nLocal and web versions of the full Microsoft Office suite are included, as well as access to Microsoft's more advanced tools like SharePoint and Intune for device management. You can also purchase a wide variety of add-on services, such as Microsoft 365 Business Voice, and these offerings are available from Microsoft or its large partner ecosystem. It may be more expensive, but for its feature list alone, it's an obvious Editors' Choice winner.\n\nThe service starts at $20 per user per month. That can add up quickly for larger organizations, but as mentioned its encyclopedic list of features makes the money worthwhile. Business Premium also has generous bedrock features at that price, which include 50GB of email hosting and 1TB of Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage in addition to domain hosting. That's an excellent overall list, though our other Editors' Choice pick, Google Workspace Business Standard, leads the pack with a whopping 2TB of mailbox storage.\n\nMore attractive to most businesses, especially in the new and distributed hybrid work model, is that you not only get the desktop, mobile, and web versions of the Microsoft Office 2019 suite but also the full version of Microsoft Teams plus team collaboration through SharePoint hosting. The bundled Intune app handles device management, so you'll be able to enforce hardware policies for home BYOD scenarios, which is something no other email hosting competitor offered.\n\nYou'll also get two forms of additional security. First is Microsoft Azure Information Protection (AIP). This is a content classification app that lets you tag documents with different classifications and assign varying levels of protection and access to them based on those tags. The second security measure is Microsoft Defender for 365. It's a 365-optimized version of the Microsoft Defender Security platform that provides antivirus and malware protection to data and endpoints. Microsoft hasn't pulled any punches, and you can try the service free for one month by visiting the company's website. For the money, the Business Premium tier will likely be the most popular purchase for most businesses.\n\nHowever, if all that is too rich or unnecessary for you, there are lower-cost options. A Microsoft 365 Business Basic edition is only $5 per user per month and includes Microsoft Teams, but relegates users to the web and mobile versions of the Office apps with no desktop versions included. The next cheapest is Microsoft 365 Apps, which will run you $8.25 per user per month but includes only the Office Premium apps (desktop and web) and OneDrive storage. Collaboration with Microsoft Teams and SharePoint is not part of this tier.\n\nFinally, the Microsoft 365 Business Standard tier should work for many smaller shops. This starts at $12.50 per user per month and includes everything in the Premium version except for Azure Information Protection, Defender, and Intune. While the prices are listed as per-user-per-month, all tiers require an annual commitment.\n\nCompared to our other Editors' Choice winner, Google Workspace Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is certainly more costly, especially since Google provides such massive mailbox storage for just $12 per user per month for its Standard tier. However, Google's bundled apps aren't nearly as comprehensive as Microsoft's, especially for data, user, and device management. It may cost more, but Microsoft 365 is still the more powerful platform.\n\nAs with any email hosting service, getting set up is often the hardest part. However, Microsoft has done a nice job of cutting through the traditionally cumbersome parts because it uses a guided setup process. It walks you through all of the major steps, such as downloading Office to every client, adding your domain name (including the option to migrate from another host), setting up Teams, and then enabling data loss prevention (DLP), which protects against anyone leaking your sensitive data. As a final step, you can configure protection for mobile app users by enabling data encryption and enforcing things such as re-authentication after a certain number of minutes.\n\nSince the copy of Office you install is already pre-linked with your account, there isn't much in the way of setup beyond running the installer and, on rare occasions, providing your log-in details. I really liked that you can do this for up to five devices per user. In today's world, it's not uncommon to have a desktop, laptop, and several mobile devices, so having a license that covers them all is not only convenient but saves money, too.\n\nManaging users is straightforward, too. Once you add a user, you'll be on the hook for an additional per-user-per-month charge, but beyond putting in some basic information and setting an initial password, there isn't much else to do.\n\nIf you need more granular control of your environment, as most larger businesses will, there's a handy admin center. This is where you'll fine-tune settings like threat management, mail flow rules, device policies, and similar IT chores. Another nice touch is that Microsoft 365 Business Premium already has standard best practices configured when it comes to security and user management. That means most small and midsized businesses (SMBs) can simply set up and go, knowing the service will cover their basic IT needs out of the box.\n\nIf you need more or something different, you can always change things in the admin center. While this part of the service is definitely intended for IT professionals, the admin center is very well organized. I could quickly find what I was looking for and access the appropriate management tools.\n\nWhile PCMag provides a deep dive on Microsoft 365's Office suite tools, an email hosting review wouldn't be complete without looking at email and collaboration tools. These are more important than ever now that we're all moving toward the new hybrid normal.\n\nCollaboration in Microsoft 365 Business Premium is essentially about Microsoft Office combined with Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. If you've used these apps separately, you'll love how they work together here. As far as the email client goes, the heart of the user experience is, of course, Microsoft Outlook.\n\nMost users have some experience with Outlook on the desktop, but with 365 Business, the really exciting stuff is happening in the web client. A recent addition, Microsoft Edit, is Microsoft's answer to Grammarly. It works across all the apps in the Office suite, but only on the web side. There's another handy feature that lets you quickly add files related to a conversation thread without having to go and search for the thread. Currently, this only works on OneDrive documents, but it's nice to have if you happen to be using the web client.\n\nIf we have a gripe with Microsoft 365, here it is: A web client should work across any browser, but Microsoft has really only focused on Windows and macOS. If you try and use a Microsoft 365 Office web app via a Linux browser, you'll almost certainly experience compatibility problems. Yes, the apps are usable overall, but you get a much smoother experience on the two commercial operating systems. Hopefully, this will change now that Microsoft is working to better integrate Linux with Windows.\n\nEven considering only the commercial operating systems, macOS is still noticeably behind Windows when it comes to how Outlook functions. Organization and advanced features are definitely lagging, which really shouldn't be the case anymore. Microsoft has also focused more on advancing its web version of Office than the desktop equivalents.\n\nFor example, aside from the Edit feature mentioned above, Redmond has made a very convenient change to the calendar. If you've had to schedule a video conference during the pandemic, you've probably had to do it for a larger number of people than usual, which means sifting through a long list of schedules until you find an open slot that works for everyone -- typically two or three months after you wanted to have the meeting. Outlook can now do that grunt work for you, using artificial intelligence (AI) to recommend times that will work best based on everyone's availability. If someone can't make it, there's a structured way to suggest alternate times. That's great, but it only works in the Outlook web client, not the desktop version.\n\nIntegration with Microsoft Teams is a given, but nevertheless important. There's a one-button option to add a Teams meeting to any meeting event. It's worth noting that invitees don't need to have the Teams client to attend, though that does give the best experience.\n\nSharePoint is another Microsoft 365 component that's probably underutilized by most customers because getting it up and running can be overwhelming. But if you need a centralized location to organize, plan, and collaborate on documents with change management enabled, this is the way to do it. It's also got task and workflow management, so it can be a little difficult to decide where to start, and you may need IT's help, but once you've got a plan for using SharePoint, other functionality will grow organically.\n\nMicrosoft does a good job with both security and privacy. Two-factor authentication is pervasive and there are a variety of data protection features beneath that. In the admin center, you can set up DLP policies that look at data and automatically classify what they recognize -- creating a rule, for example, that classifies a file as private whenever the DLP policy finds a Social Security number in it. You can also specify operations like auto-encrypting a document or restricting access and user rights.\n\nOn the email side, there's Microsoft 365 Message Encryption and Exchange Online Archiving. The former adds encryption and access rights to your emails so only the intended recipient is able to view them. It's included with Microsoft 365, but it'll work across Gmail and other email systems as well.\n\nExchange Online Archiving lets administrators set email archiving and retention policies. You can designate emails of a specific age to be automatically deleted or stored securely in the cloud, and you can do it based on content policies. For example, a healthcare organization could automatically delete most older emails, while securely archiving only those it needed to pass a future HIPAA audit. While no service is bulletproof when it comes to security, Microsoft puts up a great fight.\n\nThis all happens in the admin center, but this view offers more than just security. You'll come here to manage devices and add, delete, or modify user identities. There's also a nice dashboard right up front where the system will alert you to any problems or pressing needs associated with your account. Service downtime, a security issue, user problems, DLP queries -- it'll all be surfaced here along with the tools you'll need to address things. Finally, IT administrators that move around a lot can also get access to the admin center via a Microsoft 365 mobile app, available on both iOS and Android. The app provides instant visibility into any alert, though you'll need access to the full web admin app to address more complex problems.\n\nIf maintaining regulatory compliance is part of your job, know that Microsoft has data centers distributed across the U.S. and Northern Europe. All of them have undergone SOC auditing and achieved SOC 1 Type2, SOC 2, and SOC 3 compliance status. And if you've got a HIPPA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place, the service will cover HIPAA for you, too.\n\nThere's a much longer list of regulations that Microsoft 365 supports, but the more important news centers around the Compliance Manager. This is a workflow-oriented risk assessment tool that will help you manage all the nitty-gritty details of whatever regulation you need to support. Once you've set it up, that'll include things like data controls and retention, security policies, and audit trails, to name a few.\n\nCompliance Manager constantly scans those parameters and gives you an overall Compliance Score in your dashboard. Any problems are surfaced as alerts, and you can drill down into them for a detailed explanation and the Compliance Manager's recommendation for fixing it. This will be something of a bear to set up, but once you've got it running, it can drastically lighten your IT compliance load.\n\nMicrosoft used to win this category hands down, but Google Workspace and other email hosting players are catching up fast. Still, for the moment, we're giving Microsoft an edge here due to a partner system that's not only huge but very mature.\n\nSure, you'll find the usual names like Workspace, Slack, Trello, and Zapier on the list, but there's a whole library of other apps and integrations you can bolt-on for specific kinds of tasks, workloads, or vertical business needs. That library is so vast largely because Microsoft has traditionally pushed its development tools hard and made them available practically for free to anyone building Windows-compatible software. That created a happy developer base that even today few other companies can match.\n\nOverall, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the choice to beat in the email hosting category. Even with the big advances made by Google, Microsoft's offering still has significantly better features and its web-to-desktop experience is unrivaled. Its tools let you do everything from managing email to collaborating across teams using messaging, document sharing, and voice or video conferencing.\n\nEven strictly from an email hosting perspective, Microsoft 365 remains a leading contender. Setup, user importing and management, and a granular level of data security, loss prevention, and compliance management all come in a combination you just can't find elsewhere. Yes, it's more expensive than its rivals, but you really get what you pay for: an exceptionally well-rounded and secure end-to-end business productivity solution that's an easy pick for our Editors' Choice award.",

                "body": "Expert.ai: the Extraordinary and Ordinary\n\nShareholders' Meeting approved all the agenda\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the new 2021-2024\n\nBusiness Plan\n\nTarget 2024: Revenues and EBITDA confirmed in line\n\nwith previous plan\n\nAppointment of the Management Control Committee\n\nModena, October 15, 2021\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting of expert.ai, leader in the market of artificial intelligence applied to language understanding, (the \"Company\"), held today in Extraordinary and Ordinary session, resolved all the proposed resolutions presented by the Board of Directors:\n\nthe adoption of the one-tier system of administration and control and the related amendments to the articles of association, in order to allow for better integration of control activities within the Board of Directors through the establishment of the Management Control Committee and to help align the Company's governance with international best practices; the granting to the Board of Directors of a proxy, pursuant to articles 2443 and 2420-ter of the Italian Civil Code, to increase the share capital and/or issue convertible bonds in one or more tranches, also excluding option rights pursuant to article 2441, paragraph 5, of the Italian Civil Code, for a maximum amount of Euro 10 million to be exercised by December 31, 2024; the integration of the Board of Directors through the appointment of Patrizia Arioli and the determination of the remuneration due to the members of the Management Control Committee. Following this integration, consequent to the adoption of the one-tier system of administration and control and in the light of the project to list the Company's ordinary shares on the Mercato Telematico Azionario, the Board of Directors, that will remain in office until the Shareholders' Meeting which will discuss the approval of the financial statements as at December 31, 2021, is composed as follows:\n\n- Stefano Spaggiari (Executive Chairman)\n\n1\n\nMarco Varone (Director) Walter Lloyd Mayo III (Director) Sara Polatti (Director) Patrizia Arioli (Independent director) Alberto Sangiovanni Vincentelli (Independent Director) (1) Stefano Pedrini (Independent Director) (1) Ettore Leale (Independent Director) (1) Karen Jo Cambray (Independent Director) (1) the approval of the project for the admission to listing of the Company's ordinary shares on the Mercato Telematico Azionario and the adoption - subject to, and with effective from, the start of trading on the Mercato Telematico Azionario - of a new Company's Articles of Association in line with the best market practices of listed companies.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors, who met today, resolved, inter alia, to adopt the 2021-2024 Business Plan (the \"Business Plan\") which by continuing the growth strategy of the previous \"Path to Lead 2020-2024\" plan disclosed to the market on June 9, 2020 confirms its main objectives.\n\n2024 Targets confirmed\n\nThe main consolidated economic and financial targets as of December 31, 2024 are essentially in line with the \"Path to Lead 2020-2024\" plan:\n\nConsolidated revenues of approximately Euro 103 million(2), with licenses accounting for approximately 80%; CAGR 2020-2024 total revenues of 35% and an impact of the US revenues of approximately 50% of the total; Consolidated EBITDA of approximately Euro 24.0 million; Consolidated NFP negative for about Euro 3.8 million.\n\nThe new 2021-2024Business Plan has been formulated to correctly represent the effects of the adoption of IFRS accounting standards and to reflect the evidence found out in the first phase of execution of the \"Path to Lead 2020-2024\" plan mainly in terms of higher costs of labour.\n\nPreviously positively assessed by the Nomad pursuant to article 6-bis of the AIM Italia Issuers' Regulation. They declared to comply with the independence requirements set out in articles 147- ter, paragraph 4 and 148, paragraph 3 of the Italian Testo Unico della Finanza.\n\n(2 ) Revenues also include the grants for research and development.\n\n2\n\nWith regard to the effects of adopting the IFRS accounting standards, the higher costs mainly relate to the existing stock option and stock grant plans, for a foreseeable amount of Euro 12.8 million during the Business Plan period. Regarding the higher costs, also distributed over the four years of the Business Plan and for a foreseeable total amount of Euro 9.5 million, these are attributable to personnel, particularly in the sales and R&D area, for which the Company has found, especially in the United States but also in Europe, a limited availability of qualified professional resources and a consequent increase in the average remuneration of the personnel selected.\n\nDespite the expected increase in costs, the Business Plan envisages maintaining the existing level of indebtedness thanks to the use of the proceeds of the share capital increase carried out in July 2020, for a total of Euro 25 million, and the physiological renegotiation of the existing medium/long-term bank debt, which has already started in 2020. In this context, the Company will also be able to use of the resources coming from the exercise of the proxy pursuant to Articles 2443 and 2420-ter of the Italian Civil Code resolved by today's Shareholders' Meeting in order to have further instruments aimed at optimizing its financial structure during the implementation of the plan.\n\nIt should also be noted that the planned listing on the Mercato Telematico Azionario will take place without raising new capital, confirming the sustainability of the Industrial Plan with existing financial resources and with the same level of financial debt.\n\nGuidance 2021\n\nThe key consolidated economic and financial targets for the year ending December 31, 2021 are the following:\n\nRevenues: Euro 33 -35 million, in line with the \"Path to Lead 2020-2024\" plan; EBITDA: negative Euro 11 - 13 million; compared to the forecasts of the \"Path to Lead 2020-2024\" plan (where EBITDA 2021 was negative for Euro 4.7 million), this estimate reflects, for approximately Euro 3.0 million, the evidence of higher costs of labour, particularly in the sales area, in addition to the effect of the application of IFRS accounting standards for approximately Euro 3.0 million.\n\n*****\n\nDuring the same meeting of the Board of Directors, considering the adoption of the one-tier system of administration and control resolved by the\n\n3\n\nShareholder's Meeting, the Board of Directors also resolved to appoint as members of the Management Control Committee the following Directors:\n\nPatrizia Arioli, enrolled in the register of auditors, as Chairman of the Management Control Committee; Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli; Stefano Pedrini,\n\nPreliminarily, it was verified the existence of the independence requirements and of the additional legal requirements for the above-mentioned directors.\n\n*****\n\nWithing the context of the admission to listing on the Mercato Telematico Azionario organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A., already disclosed to the market on September 28, 2021, the Board of Directors also resolved to submit the request for publication of the Prospectus to Consob and the application for admission to listing to Borsa Italiana S.p.A.\n\nThe planned move will increase visibility and accessibility for investors around the world seeking to participate in the exponential growth in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. With 20 years of experience in AI-enabled natural language understanding (NLU), a roster of top tier Global 1000 customers, and presence across Europe and North America, Expert.ai is strongly positioned to lead the adoption of NLU technology to power better insights and decisions across the enterprise.\n\nExpert.ai launched its accelerated growth strategy in 2020 with the hiring of its first non-founder CEO and subsequent raise of Euro 25 million. With additional funds gained through disposal of assets, the company is investing in its transformation into a subscription-based Software as a Service (SaaS) model focusing on growth in the North America market and expansion of its channel partner model. The launch of the expert.ai Platform marked a breakthrough in combining the best of available AI technologies with expert.ai's unique capabilities in NLU. This integrated, intuitive, and powerful platform to design and deploy NLU solutions across any process or domain expands the potential market and scales delivery for expert.ai.\n\n4\n\n*****\n\nWalt Mayo, CEO of expert.ai, declared:\n\n\"We are excited to continue our growth and evolution with our planned listing on the MTA. This journey began more than 20 years ago, but has entered a new phase of accelerated growth at a time when adoption of AI in businesses around the world is increasing dramatically and the market for AI software is projected to reach more than $500BN in 2024(3). We intend to lead globally in bringing the power of NLU to businesses through a platform that delivers best in class performance, cost, and ease of use. Our vision is to make everyone an expert with AI tools that enable them to harness the value of language that surrounds and powers business and everyday life.\n\nSince crafting our Plan in 2020, we have continued to refine and hone our growth plans and remain committed to our target of Euro 103 Million of SaaS- driven revenue in 2024. We have planned flexibility in our investment decisions and will remain agile in our execution, particularly to ensure that we offer world-class capability for our technology delivery and the support needed to develop and grow our channel partners. And we will continue to extend and broader our offerings to make our technology relevant to all the enterprises who can realize value by turning language into data. We see, in particular, opportunity to grow rapidly in the US market, with the region generating more than 50% of our revenue in 2024.\n\nWe recognize this is an ambitious goal, but remain confident in the opportunity, our ability to execute, and the financial resources available to achieve it. This is an incredibly exciting time for expert.ai and its stakeholders and I am honored to be part of this world-class team that shares a sense of purpose and values.\"\n\n*****\n\nThis press release is available on the Company's website https://www.expert.aiand on www.emarketstorage.com.\n\nAbout expert.ai\n\n(3) International Data Corporation (IDC) \"Worldwide Semiannual Artificial Intelligence Tracker\", Aug 4,\n\n2021, https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48127321\n\n5\n\nThis is an excerpt of the original content.

                "title": "My losing stocks that will win, if I'm patient",
                "body": "It's the racing time of the year with Saturday bringing the Caulfield Cup, which is the dress rehearsal for the Melbourne Cup in three Tuesday's time. And the greatest horse trainer of the Cup's history was Bart Cummings who once said when reflecting on his training of great stayers, that \"patience is an asset\".\n\nThe same applies when it comes to investing.\n\nTraining a wonderful thoroughbred to win a time-honoured race is the high-brow aspect of the sport of kings. On the other hand, punting is the low-brow aspect and it can be compared to speculating on stocks as opposed to being an investor in quality companies for the long term.\n\nOf course, you can try and trade by buying a stock and flipping it once you're happy with the gain, but timing can be tricky -- just like betting on the four-legged lottery on Cup Day.\n\nRight now, ASIC is watching those dodgy types on the stock market who are doing something called \"pump and dump\". This involves using the online world to talk up a stock and get some tip-off to go viral via chatrooms, Facebook, Twitter or whatever. And once momentum is created, the architects of the scam dump the stock, making off with a nice profit and leaving the fooled latecomers with losses.\n\nBe really careful of that kind of scheme.\n\nIn contrast, there's a more patient play that can be rewarding, and the key word is CAN.\n\nThere are no guarantees with stocks but I thought I'd let you know how I play my more speculative hands by looking at stocks I hold that have been losers, but I think over 2022 they'll have upside.\n\nThe first is the artificial intelligence and machine learning company, Appen (ASX ticker code: APX).\n\nThis is a company that has disappointed the market and has struggled since the Coronavirus destabilised its customers. The company analysts surveyed by FNArena thinks this company has 44% upside and interestingly, all four expert company-raters are positive on the stock.\n\nAppen is a quality company with a few challenges now but, over time, I suspect it will beat those. And I really hope the Citi analysts know what they're talking about.\n\nThe chart above shows how popular this company was before the Coronavirus. I suspect that some of that popularity will eventually show up in a future share price but you'll have to have patience!\n\nAppen (APX)\n\nAnother company that I'm prepared to apply some Bart Cumming's patience to is Nuix Ltd. This was a $5 stock that after listing spiked to $11.85, before management's misreporting and unusual practices led to a huge sell-off. It's now $2.52 but the one analyst (from Morgan Stanley) that assesses the company has a target price that implies a whopping 156% gain is out there!\n\nNuix specializes in transforming massive amounts of messy data - from emails, social media, communications and other human-generated content - into searchable, contextualized information.\n\nIt has huge customers in the public and private domain and is regarded as a quality business even if its management didn't pass the same test. A lot of smart people at the investment bank Macquarie have been associated with this company and I suspect it will one day reassert itself as a quality business, but that might take time.\n\nNuix (NXL)\n\nInvestors will need some Cummings' patience with this one as well.\n\nThe next stock that has been a disappointing performer (I guess like a horse that might be out of form) is A2Milk, which actually has had a couple of good days this week, and over the past month as well.\n\nThis chart depicts the sour story of A2Milk's great reputation as a quality company that has gone off the boil.\n\nA2Milk (A2M)\n\nThis company has gone from greatness to a stock price smashing that's usually reserved for second-raters, not quality performers.\n\nThe company now has to contend with a class action taken out by the law firm Slater and Gordon, because the lawyers say the company misled investors.\n\nDespite this, its share price has bounced back over the past month, which could be a positive sign.\n\nWell, the Coronavirus was no help. A part of A2Milk's profit came from the Chinese daigou trade where Chinese travellers bought baby formula and took it back to sell at home.\n\nThe company also had inventory issues and Beijing was encouraging its citizens to support homegrown products. And then there were four downgrades from the company and the reliability of the company's reports was called into question.\n\nSo why the bounce? Well, this week a rival company, Bubs Australia, announced a better-than-expected revenue growth number and it rubbed off on A2M.\n\nBubs Australia (BUB)\n\nI don't know when A2M will be out of the woods but I'm giving it another year.\n\nAs a group, the analysts tip a 12% fall in its share price. Some tip a 20% fall, but these people are more short-term compared to a long-term investor like me! This might need more than patience. It might need divine intervention, or possibly the arrival of Chinese tourists again, but that could be six to 12 months away.\n\nThen there's the worry that Beijing might discourage tourists from coming to Oz, considering our souring relationship politically right now.\n\nMy final patience play is Fortescue (or FMG).\n\nThe consensus of analysts thinks there's 26.8% upside and Ord Minnett tips a 74% upside. The iron ore price has fallen recently but I think FMG will benefit from the economic boom of next year. And after the February Winter Olympics in China, that country could pump up production, which will be good for the iron ore price and FMG. Right now, the Beijing leadership would like blue skies for China while the Olympics is on but eventually it will be back to business as usual, and that's when demand for iron ore should rise.\n\nFive out of the seven analysts see a higher share price going forward.\n\nFortescue Metals Group (FMG)\n\nThis five-year chart of FMG shows the bounce-back history of the company. I like the fact that its founder and chairman, Andrew Twiggy Forrest, is pushing hard into the green hydrogen energy plays that will add good diversification to the company.\n\nI don't expect a big gain soon but with Cumming's-like patience in 2022, we should see some nice results.\n\n(I looked at these companies in my Switzer Investing TV program on YouTube and you can check it out with Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans with his tip of a big, big boom year for the Aussie economy next year, which has to be good for stocks! And being a long-serving AJC board member, he gives us his Everest tip for the big race at Randwick on Saturday. Can his economist computer models also pick winners at the gee-gees?)",

                "body": "Steam will no longer let games or other software onto its storefront if they engage in any cryptocurrency or NFT trading using blockchain technology.\n\nCryptocurrencies and NFTs were tagged onto to the list of prohibited application features on Steam's Steamworks Onboarding document for developers shipping titles on its platform, specifically \"[a]pplications built on blockchain technology that issue or allow exchange of cryptocurrencies or NFTs.\"\n\nIts not immediately clear when the new rule was added to the list, but according to Engadget, it appears to have been sometime after October 6. Some developers appear to have been notified directly by Valve of the rule change.\n\nValve hasn't specified why it updated its rules or what its issue with cryptocurrencies and NFTs might be, but we've reached out to Valve and will update this story if we hear back from the company.\n\nIt's no secret that I don't put much faith in cryptocurrencies to do anything other than help accelerate the destruction of our environment, and NFTs - which are at least more noble in intent, who doesn't want artists to get paid fairly for their work? - likewise look like an interesting computer science exercise in theory, but in practice, feels more like everyone collecting Furbies and expecting to retire on their investment.\n\nPeople spent $100,000 on some of those too. But NFTs might actually have some genuine utility that I'm not seeing, so I do put them in different category then cryptocurrency which is pretty much just a vehicle for tax avoidance, money-laundering, and criminal activity.\n\nOne of the ways we can find if NFTs are more than just another pop investment craze is by putting NFTs and blockchain to use in creative ways, and gaming has always been one of the biggest drivers of technological innovation.\n\nIBM developed its Watson AI platform first to win a game of Jeopardy, but now it's being used in all kinds of important industry applications that require emotive intelligence that can understand intuitive human context.\n\nTraining AI on games like Chess and Go has pushed the boundaries of artificial intelligence and led to important developments in machine learning, as has applying it to Super Mario Bros. and other popular video games. If there is a genuinely useful role for NFTs in the world, gaming is definitely one of the ways to identify and develop it.\n\nI don't know how you platform a game that rewards players with tangible real world value wgucg doesn't quickly descend into something exploitative or turn that platform into little more than a casino, but I doubt that Valve's objection is over something being exchanged that has real world value.\n\nEVE Online is still going strong, and that game very openly promoted the idea that players build ships and starbases that have real-world value - enough that climactic battles have led to the destruction of hundreds of thousands of dollars in value, in fact.\n\nWhatever Valves reasoning, some transparency is warranted as far as NFTs go, since it could be essential to proving that they're actually valuable at all.",

                "body": "This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author.\n\nThe significant changes in the way customers and businesses participate in the banking ecosystem are incoming. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in financial technology (FinTech) caused the opportunity to improve financial management systems for businesses. Advancements in technology made banking operations simpler, allowing business owners to focus on their other responsibilities and operations.\n\nOpen Banking: good or evil?\n\nAny changes to an industry raise resistance. But speaking about open banking one major benefit outweighs all the hesitations. It is the customer experience. Banks want to serve their customers well. By opening up their models to work with third-party providers (TPPs), they can ensure their customers with noticeable positive improvements in the way they manage their finances.\n\nTo survive in the competitive run and prosper, small and medium businesses (SMBs) require top-notch customer service. It includes allowing customers to pay for products and services effortlessly.\n\nWhile managing finances, owners of small businesses have always bear in mind some things to stay afloat:\n\nMaintaining financial health is always a goal of a business owner. The right financial tools and the adoption of innovative technology are needed to improve return on investment (ROI) and keep customers happy.\n\nIt's common for small businesses to use external services to manage their finances. Various financial services are available for SMBs, like accounting, consulting, and loan management.\n\nRunning an SMB requires more than just showing up and selling products to a customer. Understanding that fact helps SMB owners decide if open banking is the right choice for their business.\n\nOpen Banking: benefits for SMBs\n\nThere are benefits for individual consumers and SMBs When individual consumers and SMBs choose to exploit an open banking system, they obtain certain benefits out of it. Individuals get wider access to the data they need any time when they need it.\n\nRead my article about Open banking for Consumer Lending.\n\nSMBs, in their turn, are benefited from the following advantages in comparison with cooperating with traditional banking.\n\nOpen Banking: privacy\n\nIt's in the nature of banking that the security of consumer information is regarded with utmost importance. By opening up accessibility, financial institutions make the question of online security the concern of conversation.\n\nFinancial data leaks are always a concern for financial institutions and TPPs. They are constantly looking for new ways to reduce the risk of cybersecurity breaches. It's already required by legislation that all parties take measures to protect consumers so they can contribute to a thriving open banking ecosystem.\n\nBanks and TPPs alike must take all necessary measures to protect their customers from losing their assets. It's essential to provide consumers with educational resources if they are interested in participating in open banking. Transparency is key.\n\nManaging Business Finances Open Banking: business finance management\n\nThey say, \"Don't fix what is not broken.\" This may seem true for the banking industry right now. But it's becoming a thing from the past to transfer and handle money through the bank or the branches they maintain. Innovation in technology is allowing for seamless money transfers, secure online payments, and automation of business processes.\n\nThough the methods of traditional banking are not entirely outdated, it's extremely unwise to deny the importance of FinTech.",

                "body": "In this exclusive interview with EL PAÍS, the South Korean-born philosopher discusses digital subjugation, the disappearance of ritual and what 'Squid Game' reveals about society\n\nThe material world of atoms and molecules, of things we can touch and smell, is dissolving away into a world of non-things, according to the South Korean-born Swiss-German philosopher Byung-Chul Han. We continue to desire these non-things, and even to buy and sell them, Han says. They continue to influence us. While the digital world is increasingly blurred with what we still consider the \"real\" world, our existence is ever more intangible and fleeting, he believes. The best-selling thinker, sometimes referred to as a rockstar philosopher, is still meticulously dissecting the anxieties produced by neoliberal capitalism.\n\nBy combining quotations from great philosophers and elements of popular culture, Han's latest book Undinge (or Nonobjects), which is yet to be published in English, analyzes our \"burnout society,\" in which we live exhausted and depressed by the unavoidable demands of existence. He has also considered new forms of entertainment and \"psychopolitics,\" where citizens surrender meekly to the seduction of the system, along with the disappearance of eroticism, which Han blames on current trends for narcissism and exhibitionism.\n\nThis narcissism runs riot on social media, he believes, where the obsession with oneself makes others disappear and the world becomes a simple reflection of us as individuals. The philosopher strives to recover intimate contact in everyday life - he is known for his interest in gardening, making things with his hands and sitting in silence. He despairs of \"the disappearance of rituals,\" which also makes entire communities disappear along with them. We become lost individuals, in sick and cruel societies.\n\nByung-Chul Han conducted this interview with EL PAÍS by email in German, which has subsequently been translated and edited for clarity.\n\nQuestion. How is it possible that in a world obsessed with hyperproduction and hyperconsumption, at the same time objects are disappearing and we are moving toward a world of non-things?\n\nAnswer. There is without a doubt a hyperinflation of objects, meaning they are everywhere. However, these are disposable objects that we cannot really bond with. Today we are obsessed not with things, but with information and data, that is to say, non-things. Today we are all infomaniacs. We even have the concept of datasexuals [people who obsessively collect and share information about their personal lives].\n\nQ. In this world you describe, one of hyper-consumption where relationships are lost, why is it important to have objects that we love, and to establish rituals?\n\nA. These things are a support structure that provides peace of mind in life. Nowadays, that is often obscured by information. The smartphone is not a thing. It produces and processes information, and information gives us the opposite of peace of mind. It lives off the stimulus of surprise, and of immersing us in a whirlwind of news. Rituals give life some stability. The pandemic has destroyed these temporal structures. Think of remote working. When time loses its structure, depression sets in.\n\nQ. Your book states that in a digital world we will become \"homo ludens,\" focused on play rather than work. But given the precariousness of the job market, will we all be able to access that lifestyle?\n\nA. I have talked about digital unemployment. Digitalization will lead to mass unemployment, and that will represent a very serious problem in the future. Will the human future consist of basic income and computer games? That's a discouraging outlook. In Panem et circenses [or Bread and Circuses], [Roman poet] Juvenal refers to a Roman society where political action is not possible. People are kept happy with free food and entertainment. Total domination arrives when society is only engaged in play. The recent Korean Netflix show Squid Game points in this direction.\n\nQ. In what way?\n\nA. [In the series] the characters are in debt and agree to play this deadly game that promises them huge winnings. The Squid Game represents a central aspect of capitalism in an extreme form. [German philosopher] Walter Benjamin said that capitalism represents the first case of a cult that is not sacrificial but puts us into debt. In the early days of digitalization, people dreamed that work would be replaced by play. In reality, digital capitalism ruthlessly exploits the human drive for play. Think of social media, which deliberately incorporates playful elements to cause addiction in users.\n\nQ. Indeed, smartphones promised us a certain freedom... but are we not in fact imprisoned by them?\n\nA. The smartphone today is either a digital workplace or a digital confessional. Every device, and every technique of domination, generates totems that are used for subjugation. This is how domination is strengthened. The smartphone is the cult object of digital domination. As a subjugation device, it acts like a rosary and its beads; this is how we keep a smartphone constantly at hand. The 'like' is a digital \"amen.\" We keep going to confession. We undress by choice. But we don't ask for forgiveness: instead, we call out for attention.\n\nQ. Some fear that the Internet of Things could one day mean that objects will rebel against human beings.\n\nA. Not exactly. The smart home of interconnected objects represents a digital prison. The smart bed with sensors extends surveillance even during sleep. Surveillance is increasingly and surreptitiously imposing itself on everyday life, as if it were just the convenient thing to do. Digital things are proving to be efficient informants that constantly monitor and control us.\n\nQ. You have described how work is becoming more like a game, and social media, paradoxically, makes us feel freer. Capitalism seduces us. Has the system managed to dominate us in a way that is actually pleasing to us?\n\nA. Only a repressive regime provokes resistance. On the contrary, the neoliberal regime, which does not oppress freedom, but exploits it, does not face any resistance. It is not repressive, but seductive. Domination becomes complete the moment it presents itself as freedom.\n\nQ. Why, despite growing precarity and inequality, does the everyday world in Western countries seem so beautiful, hyper-designed and optimistic? Why doesn't it seem like a dystopian or cyberpunk movie?\n\nA. George Orwell's novel 1984 has recently become a worldwide bestseller. People sense that something is wrong in our digital comfort zone. But our society is more like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. In 1984, people are controlled by the threat of harm. In Brave New World, they are controlled by administering pleasure. The state distributes a drug called \"soma\" to make everyone feel happy. That is our future.\n\nQ. You suggest that artificial intelligence or big data are not the incredible forms of knowledge they are promoted to be, but rather \"rudimentary.\" Why is that?\n\nA. Big data is only a very primitive form of knowledge, namely correlation: if A happens, then B happens. There is no understanding. Artificial intelligence does not think. Artificial intelligence doesn't get goosebumps.\n\nQ. French writer and mathematician Blaise Pascal said that: \"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\" We live in a cult of productivity, even during what we call \"free\" time. You named it, with great success, the burnout society. Should the recovery of our own time be set as a political objective?\n\nA. Human existence today is totally absorbed by activity. This makes it completely exploitable. Inactivity reappears in the capitalist system of domination as an incorporation of something external. It is called leisure time, and as it serves to recover from work, it remains linked to it. We need a policy of inactivity. This could serve to free up time from the obligations of production and make real leisure time possible.\n\nQ. How do you reconcile a society that tries to homogenize us with people's growing desire to be different from others, to be in a certain way, unique?\n\nA. Everyone today wants to be authentic, that is, different from others. We are constantly comparing ourselves with others. It is precisely this comparison that makes us all the same. In other words: the obligation to be authentic leads to the hell of sameness.\n\nQ. Do we need more silence, more willingness to listen to others?\n\nA. We need information to be silenced. Otherwise, our brains will explode. Today we perceive the world through information. That's how we lose the experience of being present. We are increasingly disconnected from the world. We are losing the world. The world is more than information, and the screen is a poor representation of the world. We revolve in a circle around ourselves. The smartphone contributes decisively to this poor perception of the world. A fundamental symptom of depression is the absence of the world.\n\nQ. Depression is one of the most alarming health problems we are facing today. How does this \"absence of world\" operate?\n\nA. When we are depressed we lose our relationship with the world, with the other. We sink into a scattered ego. I think digitalization, and the smartphone, make us depressed. There are stories of dentists who say that their patients cling to their phones when a treatment is painful. Why do they do that? Thanks to the smartphone, I am aware of myself. It helps me to be certain that I am alive, that I exist. That's why we cling to our cellphones in situations like dental treatment. As a child, I remember holding my mother's hand at the dentist's office. Today the mother will not offer the child her hand, but a cellphone. Support does not come from others, but from oneself. That makes us sick. We have to recover the other person.\n\nQ. According to the philosopher Fredric Jameson, it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. Can you picture some form of post-capitalism, now that it seems to be in decline?\n\nA. Capitalism really responds to the instinctive structures of man. But man is not only an instinctive being. We have to tame, civilize and humanize capitalism. That is also possible. The social market economy is a demonstration of it. But our economy is entering a new era, the era of sustainability.\n\nQ. You received your doctorate with a thesis on German philosopher Martin Heidegger, who explored the most abstract forms of thought and whose texts are very obscure to the layman. Yet you manage to apply that abstract thinking to issues that anyone can experience. Should philosophy be more concerned with a world where the majority of the population lives?\n\nA. [French philosopher] Michel Foucault defines philosophy as a kind of radical journalism, and he considers himself a journalist. Philosophers should be concerned with today, with current affairs. In this, I follow Foucault's lead. I try to interpret today in my thoughts. These thoughts are precisely what set us free.",

A rheumatoid arthritis patient's gut microbiome may indicate whether the condition will improve over time, according to a recent study published in Genome Medicine shows.\n\nResearchers at the Mayo Clinic used gut microbiome data and artificial intelligence to predict clinical outcomes with an accuracy of 90%.\n\n\"There's microbiome on the skin, in the lungs, everywhere,\" said Dr. Bob Lahita, director of the Institute for Autoimmune and Rheumatic Diseases at St. Joseph Health and author of the forthcoming book \"Immunity Strong,\" to CBSN. \"And they stimulate the immune system. They actually are involved in the development of our nervous system and our brain and they're the main source of vitamins, like vitamin K and vitamin B. They also protect our bowels from infection and from organisms going into our bloodstream.\"\n\nFor patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the body, Lahita said probiotics in the gut \"are really, really important to controlling -- believe it or not -- the course of this disease.\"\n\nResearchers collected two stool samples from 32 patients with rheumatoid arthritis about 6 to 12 months apart, and different microbiome traits were discovered for patients who showed clinical improvement and for those who did not.\n\nThe study could change future treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, Lahita said.\n\n\"And we're just learning about this,\" he said, adding that researchers and doctors could potentially eliminate specific strains of bacteria in the gut.\n\nMany people already take either prebiotics and probiotics to help their health -- or both.\n\n\"Prebiotics, setting up your bowel for the proper organisms going forward -- and they claim it's a real boon to their health. And the second is probiotics a lot of people take, such as yogurt and other kinds of bacterial seeding, that they can use to make their bowels more efficient,\" said Lahita. \"And this all has an effect on your disease.\"",

                "body": "Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the most feature-rich email hosting provider we've tested, which stands to reason seeing as how it's been around such a long time. The service makes domain and email setup easy for any sized business and has lots of migration and importing tools if you're coming from another platform.\n\nLocal and web versions of the full Microsoft Office suite are included, as well as access to Microsoft's more advanced tools like SharePoint and Intune for device management. You can also purchase a wide variety of add-on services, such as Microsoft 365 Business Voice, and these offerings are available from Microsoft or its large partner ecosystem. It may be more expensive, but for its feature list alone, it's an obvious Editors' Choice winner.\n\nThe service starts at $20 per user per month. That can add up quickly for larger organizations, but as mentioned its encyclopedic list of features makes the money worthwhile. Business Premium also has generous bedrock features at that price, which include 50GB of email hosting and 1TB of Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage in addition to domain hosting. That's an excellent overall list, though our other Editors' Choice pick, Google Workspace Business Standard, leads the pack with a whopping 2TB of mailbox storage.\n\nMore attractive to most businesses, especially in the new and distributed hybrid work model, is that you not only get the desktop, mobile, and web versions of the Microsoft Office 2019 suite but also the full version of Microsoft Teams plus team collaboration through SharePoint hosting. The bundled Intune app handles device management, so you'll be able to enforce hardware policies for home BYOD scenarios, which is something no other email hosting competitor offered.\n\nYou'll also get two forms of additional security. First is Microsoft Azure Information Protection (AIP). This is a content classification app that lets you tag documents with different classifications and assign varying levels of protection and access to them based on those tags. The second security measure is Microsoft Defender for 365. It's a 365-optimized version of the Microsoft Defender Security platform that provides antivirus and malware protection to data and endpoints. Microsoft hasn't pulled any punches, and you can try the service free for one month by visiting the company's website. For the money, the Business Premium tier will likely be the most popular purchase for most businesses.\n\nHowever, if all that is too rich or unnecessary for you, there are lower-cost options. A Microsoft 365 Business Basic edition is only $5 per user per month and includes Microsoft Teams, but relegates users to the web and mobile versions of the Office apps with no desktop versions included. The next cheapest is Microsoft 365 Apps, which will run you $8.25 per user per month but includes only the Office Premium apps (desktop and web) and OneDrive storage. Collaboration with Microsoft Teams and SharePoint is not part of this tier.\n\nFinally, the Microsoft 365 Business Standard tier should work for many smaller shops. This starts at $12.50 per user per month and includes everything in the Premium version except for Azure Information Protection, Defender, and Intune. While the prices are listed as per-user-per-month, all tiers require an annual commitment.\n\nCompared to our other Editors' Choice winner, Google Workspace Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is certainly more costly, especially since Google provides such massive mailbox storage for just $12 per user per month for its Standard tier. However, Google's bundled apps aren't nearly as comprehensive as Microsoft's, especially for data, user, and device management. It may cost more, but Microsoft 365 is still the more powerful platform.\n\nAs with any email hosting service, getting set up is often the hardest part. However, Microsoft has done a nice job of cutting through the traditionally cumbersome parts because it uses a guided setup process. It walks you through all of the major steps, such as downloading Office to every client, adding your domain name (including the option to migrate from another host), setting up Teams, and then enabling data loss prevention (DLP), which protects against anyone leaking your sensitive data. As a final step, you can configure protection for mobile app users by enabling data encryption and enforcing things such as re-authentication after a certain number of minutes.\n\nSince the copy of Office you install is already pre-linked with your account, there isn't much in the way of setup beyond running the installer and, on rare occasions, providing your log-in details. I really liked that you can do this for up to five devices per user. In today's world, it's not uncommon to have a desktop, laptop, and several mobile devices, so having a license that covers them all is not only convenient but saves money, too.\n\nManaging users is straightforward, too. Once you add a user, you'll be on the hook for an additional per-user-per-month charge, but beyond putting in some basic information and setting an initial password, there isn't much else to do.\n\nIf you need more granular control of your environment, as most larger businesses will, there's a handy admin center. This is where you'll fine-tune settings like threat management, mail flow rules, device policies, and similar IT chores. Another nice touch is that Microsoft 365 Business Premium already has standard best practices configured when it comes to security and user management. That means most small and midsized businesses (SMBs) can simply set up and go, knowing the service will cover their basic IT needs out of the box.\n\nIf you need more or something different, you can always change things in the admin center. While this part of the service is definitely intended for IT professionals, the admin center is very well organized. I could quickly find what I was looking for and access the appropriate management tools.\n\nWhile PCMag provides a deep dive on Microsoft 365's Office suite tools, an email hosting review wouldn't be complete without looking at email and collaboration tools. These are more important than ever now that we're all moving toward the new hybrid normal.\n\nCollaboration in Microsoft 365 Business Premium is essentially about Microsoft Office combined with Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. If you've used these apps separately, you'll love how they work together here. As far as the email client goes, the heart of the user experience is, of course, Microsoft Outlook.\n\nMost users have some experience with Outlook on the desktop, but with 365 Business, the really exciting stuff is happening in the web client. A recent addition, Microsoft Edit, is Microsoft's answer to Grammarly. It works across all the apps in the Office suite, but only on the web side. There's another handy feature that lets you quickly add files related to a conversation thread without having to go and search for the thread. Currently, this only works on OneDrive documents, but it's nice to have if you happen to be using the web client.\n\nIf we have a gripe with Microsoft 365, here it is: A web client should work across any browser, but Microsoft has really only focused on Windows and macOS. If you try and use a Microsoft 365 Office web app via a Linux browser, you'll almost certainly experience compatibility problems. Yes, the apps are usable overall, but you get a much smoother experience on the two commercial operating systems. Hopefully, this will change now that Microsoft is working to better integrate Linux with Windows.\n\nEven considering only the commercial operating systems, macOS is still noticeably behind Windows when it comes to how Outlook functions. Organization and advanced features are definitely lagging, which really shouldn't be the case anymore. Microsoft has also focused more on advancing its web version of Office than the desktop equivalents.\n\nFor example, aside from the Edit feature mentioned above, Redmond has made a very convenient change to the calendar. If you've had to schedule a video conference during the pandemic, you've probably had to do it for a larger number of people than usual, which means sifting through a long list of schedules until you find an open slot that works for everyone -- typically two or three months after you wanted to have the meeting. Outlook can now do that grunt work for you, using artificial intelligence (AI) to recommend times that will work best based on everyone's availability. If someone can't make it, there's a structured way to suggest alternate times. That's great, but it only works in the Outlook web client, not the desktop version.\n\nIntegration with Microsoft Teams is a given, but nevertheless important. There's a one-button option to add a Teams meeting to any meeting event. It's worth noting that invitees don't need to have the Teams client to attend, though that does give the best experience.\n\nSharePoint is another Microsoft 365 component that's probably underutilized by most customers because getting it up and running can be overwhelming. But if you need a centralized location to organize, plan, and collaborate on documents with change management enabled, this is the way to do it. It's also got task and workflow management, so it can be a little difficult to decide where to start, and you may need IT's help, but once you've got a plan for using SharePoint, other functionality will grow organically.\n\nMicrosoft does a good job with both security and privacy. Two-factor authentication is pervasive and there are a variety of data protection features beneath that. In the admin center, you can set up DLP policies that look at data and automatically classify what they recognize -- creating a rule, for example, that classifies a file as private whenever the DLP policy finds a Social Security number in it. You can also specify operations like auto-encrypting a document or restricting access and user rights.\n\nOn the email side, there's Microsoft 365 Message Encryption and Exchange Online Archiving. The former adds encryption and access rights to your emails so only the intended recipient is able to view them. It's included with Microsoft 365, but it'll work across Gmail and other email systems as well.\n\nExchange Online Archiving lets administrators set email archiving and retention policies. You can designate emails of a specific age to be automatically deleted or stored securely in the cloud, and you can do it based on content policies. For example, a healthcare organization could automatically delete most older emails, while securely archiving only those it needed to pass a future HIPAA audit. While no service is bulletproof when it comes to security, Microsoft puts up a great fight.\n\nThis all happens in the admin center, but this view offers more than just security. You'll come here to manage devices and add, delete, or modify user identities. There's also a nice dashboard right up front where the system will alert you to any problems or pressing needs associated with your account. Service downtime, a security issue, user problems, DLP queries -- it'll all be surfaced here along with the tools you'll need to address things. Finally, IT administrators that move around a lot can also get access to the admin center via a Microsoft 365 mobile app, available on both iOS and Android. The app provides instant visibility into any alert, though you'll need access to the full web admin app to address more complex problems.\n\nIf maintaining regulatory compliance is part of your job, know that Microsoft has data centers distributed across the U.S. and Northern Europe. All of them have undergone SOC auditing and achieved SOC 1 Type2, SOC 2, and SOC 3 compliance status. And if you've got a HIPPA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place, the service will cover HIPAA for you, too.\n\nThere's a much longer list of regulations that Microsoft 365 supports, but the more important news centers around the Compliance Manager. This is a workflow-oriented risk assessment tool that will help you manage all the nitty-gritty details of whatever regulation you need to support. Once you've set it up, that'll include things like data controls and retention, security policies, and audit trails, to name a few.\n\nCompliance Manager constantly scans those parameters and gives you an overall Compliance Score in your dashboard. Any problems are surfaced as alerts, and you can drill down into them for a detailed explanation and the Compliance Manager's recommendation for fixing it. This will be something of a bear to set up, but once you've got it running, it can drastically lighten your IT compliance load.\n\nMicrosoft used to win this category hands down, but Google Workspace and other email hosting players are catching up fast. Still, for the moment, we're giving Microsoft an edge here due to a partner system that's not only huge but very mature.\n\nSure, you'll find the usual names like Workspace, Slack, Trello, and Zapier on the list, but there's a whole library of other apps and integrations you can bolt-on for specific kinds of tasks, workloads, or vertical business needs. That library is so vast largely because Microsoft has traditionally pushed its development tools hard and made them available practically for free to anyone building Windows-compatible software. That created a happy developer base that even today few other companies can match.\n\nOverall, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the choice to beat in the email hosting category. Even with the big advances made by Google, Microsoft's offering still has significantly better features and its web-to-desktop experience is unrivaled. Its tools let you do everything from managing email to collaborating across teams using messaging, document sharing, and voice or video conferencing.\n\nEven strictly from an email hosting perspective, Microsoft 365 remains a leading contender. Setup, user importing and management, and a granular level of data security, loss prevention, and compliance management all come in a combination you just can't find elsewhere. Yes, it's more expensive than its rivals, but you really get what you pay for: an exceptionally well-rounded and secure end-to-end business productivity solution that's an easy pick for our Editors' Choice award.",

GlobalData forecasts the mobile 5G services market will be worth $644.6bn by 2026, equivalent to 64% of total mobile service revenue worldwide.\n\n\"Taking a cue from Apple, and moving towards end-to-end control of the user experience, the Pixel 6 series will come with Google's own Tensor chip - Google's first foray into reverse engineering the smartphone. Industry interest in this phone is high, as Tensor will focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, providing a foundation for future innovations. It's a significant move by Google because making a chip is a complex and expensive process, and Google, a company that isn't strong in smartphones, is investing money and resources into this process. It would allow Google to better compete in the smartphone marketplace. The company can also improve upon the chip and use it in its wearables, which will also benefit Samsung and Fitbit as they are Google's wearable partners.\n\n\"In addition to computational photography improvements - a Pixel strength - Google is taking a page out of Apple's playbook to create a multifaceted services ecosystem. Google is expected to launch the Pixel Pass in response to the Apple One services bundle, which will provide the Pixel 6 phones with premium Google services such as YouTube Premium, Google One, Play Pass and Google Fi.\n\n\"Including access to Google Fi, Google's US-based mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), in the Pixel Pass will help Google further exploit 5G growth in North America, a primary market for Pixel. GlobalData expects North America to generate 5G service revenues of $195.7bn by 2026.\"\n\nAttachments\n\nOriginal document Permalink\n\nDisclaimer\n\nGlobalData plc published this content on 15 October 2021 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

                "title": "CDO Council sees administration's equity goals increase demand for data | Federal News Network",
                "body": "Nearly two years after holding its first meeting, the Chief Data Officers Council is seeking input on how to meet its mission.\n\nThe council, as part of its request for information issued this week, is asking the public how best to upskill federal employees for data literacy. The council is also seeking best practices on how to inventory agency data, and share federal data between agencies while still upholding privacy.\n\nMeanwhile, the council is putting together a CDO playbook, focused on maximizing the impact of CDOs at their agencies.\n\nChief data officers are relatively new additions to most agencies, but the Biden administration sees them as an essential part of some of its top priorities.\n\nThe CDO Council held its first public meeting Thursday and gave a status update on progress made under the Federal Data Strategy. The council, since holding its first meeting in January 2020, has stood up working groups focused on data workforce skills, data sharing, data inventories and stakeholder engagement.\n\nDeputy Federal CIO Maria Roat, speaking at the recent CDO Council meeting, said the Federal Data Strategy set a 10-year vision for agencies to use data to drive decision-making and better serve the public, and that CDOs are making significant progress.\n\n\"They have come out of the gate running, establishing working groups and really initiating on a lot of activity across the federal government,\" Roat said.\n\nThe Biden administration also set up an Equitable Data Working Group as part of an executive order on promoting racial equity through the federal government.\n\nThe Equitable Data Working Group is reviewing inadequacies in existing federal data collection activities, as well as infrastructure and policies.\n\nBut Dominic Mancini, the deputy administrator of OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, says CDOs are doing the day-to-day work to meet the administration's goals.\n\n\"We are really in the business of trying to put a spotlight on the need for both more access to the data, information relevant to equity, while maintaining confidentiality. That will be an inherently more sensitive data set if you think about what the kinds of underserved populations and the information we may want from them. And so really, that comes down to trust, it comes down to maintaining the infrastructure of data policy within the government,\" Mancini said.\n\nCDO Council chairman Ted Kaouk said agencies are looking at ways to better leverage their data to make progress on some of the administration's biggest goals, including COVID-19 recovery, climate change and equity in government.\n\nKaouk says all of those administration goals require better data management, as well as investments in federal workforce training and infrastructure.\n\n\"Recent executive orders of the Biden-Harris administration really reinforced the need for quality data to tackle some of the nation's biggest challenges, and again, signal that holistic reexamination of the federal government's practices for collecting, using, sharing and disseminating data,\" Kaouk said.\n\nDan Morgan, the Transportation Department's CDO who leads the council's working group on data sharing, said agencies don't just need to get their own data in order. They also need to work together and share data to accomplish some of the administration's biggest priorities.\n\n\"If you've been following the administration's Equitable Data Working Group, you'll know that data sharing is a key piece of what it will take for us to be able to gather more and better granular data about socio-demographic groups that are of interest to us or our concern, so that we can direct federal resources in the most productive way possible,\" Morgan said.\n\nKaouk currently serves as the CDO for the Agriculture Department, but later this month will move to the Office of Personnel Management to become its CDO and deputy director for human capital data management and modernization.\n\nKaouk said agencies must also improve data maturity as artificial intelligence and machine learning tools gain more widespread acceptance in government.\n\n\"There are many emerging opportunities to improve the use of data, but this must also be accomplished with a focus on ethical data practices, and strong privacy protections that reduce the risk of re-identification to give added confidence to our data sharing and dissemination activities,\" Kaouk said.\n\nThe council worked across agencies earlier in the pandemic to share data held by the Centers for Disease Control and the rest of the Department of Health and Human Services more easily with the rest of the government.\n\nKaouk said this work also helped CDOs better understand how to set up shared data infrastructure across multiple agencies on urgent issues.\n\nDespite this progress, CDOs are running into a few common hurdles, like making sure the federal workforce has the necessary data skills, as well as a baseline data literacy.\n\nThomas Beach, the Commerce Department's interim CDO and head of the council's working group on the workforce, said agencies need a convergence of IT skills, data and analytics skills, business expertise and \"soft skills\" from their workforce to meet the Federal Data Strategy's goals.\n\nBut Beach says agencies will need a range of data expertise from its workforce.\n\n\"We're not in government trying to make everyone a data scientist. We're tackling this concept of data skills in the most holistic definition, meaning there are those that have a certain level of data acumen, all the way to the executive leadership that has a certain level of data acumen, and then everything in between, with the expertise creating, and the expertise around visualization and data storytelling,\" Beach said.\n\nBeach said the council is drafting a CDO playbook looking at where CDOs should focus most of their effort to maximize impact in the short and long term.\n\n\"The role of a CDO is to make things happen, to figure it out and create outcomes. It's not just to define things and to use buzzwords like data management and governance and things like that. It's really to say, 'OK, what can we really make happen?'\" Beach said.\n\nTod Dabolt, the Interior Department's CDO, serves as the head of the data inventory working group. He said agencies are working towards marketing more of their data for commercial use.\n\n\"More and more, we see the value of government data in the commercial sector, both in regulated entities, as well as the tech and data sectors, huge growth in taking data through organizations like the Department of Commerce, and the National Weather Service, and adding additional value to that data, and serving it back in the form of enhanced weather capabilities,\" Dabolt said.\n\nBut part of that challenge is making agency data easily accessible and easily searchable. Dabolt says users don't want to have to search multiple platforms to find data from a single agency.\n\n\"I don't want to go to the [U.S. Geological Survey] or the Fish and Wildlife Service and navigate through their website to find a piece of data to answer a policy discussion or inform a policy discussion. you just want to search for it. You don't want to go across multiple platforms, you don't want to learn multiple interfaces. And you don't want to have a login for this site, and that site and this site, just to find a piece of government information,\" Dabolt said.",

                "title": "Microsoft 365 Business Premium",
                "body": "Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the most feature-rich email hosting provider we've tested, which stands to reason seeing as how it's been around such a long time. The service makes domain and email setup easy for any sized business and has lots of migration and importing tools if you're coming from another platform.\n\nLocal and web versions of the full Microsoft Office suite are included, as well as access to Microsoft's more advanced tools like SharePoint and Intune for device management. You can also purchase a wide variety of add-on services, such as Microsoft 365 Business Voice, and these offerings are available from Microsoft or its large partner ecosystem. It may be more expensive, but for its feature list alone, it's an obvious Editors' Choice winner.\n\nThe service starts at $20 per user per month. That can add up quickly for larger organizations, but as mentioned its encyclopedic list of features makes the money worthwhile. Business Premium also has generous bedrock features at that price, which include 50GB of email hosting and 1TB of Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage in addition to domain hosting. That's an excellent overall list, though our other Editors' Choice pick, Google Workspace Business Standard, leads the pack with a whopping 2TB of mailbox storage.\n\nMore attractive to most businesses, especially in the new and distributed hybrid work model, is that you not only get the desktop, mobile, and web versions of the Microsoft Office 2019 suite but also the full version of Microsoft Teams plus team collaboration through SharePoint hosting. The bundled Intune app handles device management, so you'll be able to enforce hardware policies for home BYOD scenarios, which is something no other email hosting competitor offered.\n\nYou'll also get two forms of additional security. First is Microsoft Azure Information Protection (AIP). This is a content classification app that lets you tag documents with different classifications and assign varying levels of protection and access to them based on those tags. The second security measure is Microsoft Defender for 365. It's a 365-optimized version of the Microsoft Defender Security platform that provides antivirus and malware protection to data and endpoints. Microsoft hasn't pulled any punches, and you can try the service free for one month by visiting the company's website. For the money, the Business Premium tier will likely be the most popular purchase for most businesses.\n\nHowever, if all that is too rich or unnecessary for you, there are lower-cost options. A Microsoft 365 Business Basic edition is only $5 per user per month and includes Microsoft Teams, but relegates users to the web and mobile versions of the Office apps with no desktop versions included. The next cheapest is Microsoft 365 Apps, which will run you $8.25 per user per month but includes only the Office Premium apps (desktop and web) and OneDrive storage. Collaboration with Microsoft Teams and SharePoint is not part of this tier.\n\nFinally, the Microsoft 365 Business Standard tier should work for many smaller shops. This starts at $12.50 per user per month and includes everything in the Premium version except for Azure Information Protection, Defender, and Intune. While the prices are listed as per-user-per-month, all tiers require an annual commitment.\n\nCompared to our other Editors' Choice winner, Google Workspace Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is certainly more costly, especially since Google provides such massive mailbox storage for just $12 per user per month for its Standard tier. However, Google's bundled apps aren't nearly as comprehensive as Microsoft's, especially for data, user, and device management. It may cost more, but Microsoft 365 is still the more powerful platform.\n\nAs with any email hosting service, getting set up is often the hardest part. However, Microsoft has done a nice job of cutting through the traditionally cumbersome parts because it uses a guided setup process. It walks you through all of the major steps, such as downloading Office to every client, adding your domain name (including the option to migrate from another host), setting up Teams, and then enabling data loss prevention (DLP), which protects against anyone leaking your sensitive data. As a final step, you can configure protection for mobile app users by enabling data encryption and enforcing things such as re-authentication after a certain number of minutes.\n\nSince the copy of Office you install is already pre-linked with your account, there isn't much in the way of setup beyond running the installer and, on rare occasions, providing your log-in details. I really liked that you can do this for up to five devices per user. In today's world, it's not uncommon to have a desktop, laptop, and several mobile devices, so having a license that covers them all is not only convenient but saves money, too.\n\nManaging users is straightforward, too. Once you add a user, you'll be on the hook for an additional per-user-per-month charge, but beyond putting in some basic information and setting an initial password, there isn't much else to do.\n\nIf you need more granular control of your environment, as most larger businesses will, there's a handy admin center. This is where you'll fine-tune settings like threat management, mail flow rules, device policies, and similar IT chores. Another nice touch is that Microsoft 365 Business Premium already has standard best practices configured when it comes to security and user management. That means most small and midsized businesses (SMBs) can simply set up and go, knowing the service will cover their basic IT needs out of the box.\n\nIf you need more or something different, you can always change things in the admin center. While this part of the service is definitely intended for IT professionals, the admin center is very well organized. I could quickly find what I was looking for and access the appropriate management tools.\n\nWhile PCMag provides a deep dive on Microsoft 365's Office suite tools, an email hosting review wouldn't be complete without looking at email and collaboration tools. These are more important than ever now that we're all moving toward the new hybrid normal.\n\nCollaboration in Microsoft 365 Business Premium is essentially about Microsoft Office combined with Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. If you've used these apps separately, you'll love how they work together here. As far as the email client goes, the heart of the user experience is, of course, Microsoft Outlook.\n\nMost users have some experience with Outlook on the desktop, but with 365 Business, the really exciting stuff is happening in the web client. A recent addition, Microsoft Edit, is Microsoft's answer to Grammarly. It works across all the apps in the Office suite, but only on the web side. There's another handy feature that lets you quickly add files related to a conversation thread without having to go and search for the thread. Currently, this only works on OneDrive documents, but it's nice to have if you happen to be using the web client.\n\nIf we have a gripe with Microsoft 365, here it is: A web client should work across any browser, but Microsoft has really only focused on Windows and macOS. If you try and use a Microsoft 365 Office web app via a Linux browser, you'll almost certainly experience compatibility problems. Yes, the apps are usable overall, but you get a much smoother experience on the two commercial operating systems. Hopefully, this will change now that Microsoft is working to better integrate Linux with Windows.\n\nEven considering only the commercial operating systems, macOS is still noticeably behind Windows when it comes to how Outlook functions. Organization and advanced features are definitely lagging, which really shouldn't be the case anymore. Microsoft has also focused more on advancing its web version of Office than the desktop equivalents.\n\nFor example, aside from the Edit feature mentioned above, Redmond has made a very convenient change to the calendar. If you've had to schedule a video conference during the pandemic, you've probably had to do it for a larger number of people than usual, which means sifting through a long list of schedules until you find an open slot that works for everyone -- typically two or three months after you wanted to have the meeting. Outlook can now do that grunt work for you, using artificial intelligence (AI) to recommend times that will work best based on everyone's availability. If someone can't make it, there's a structured way to suggest alternate times. That's great, but it only works in the Outlook web client, not the desktop version.\n\nIntegration with Microsoft Teams is a given, but nevertheless important. There's a one-button option to add a Teams meeting to any meeting event. It's worth noting that invitees don't need to have the Teams client to attend, though that does give the best experience.\n\nSharePoint is another Microsoft 365 component that's probably underutilized by most customers because getting it up and running can be overwhelming. But if you need a centralized location to organize, plan, and collaborate on documents with change management enabled, this is the way to do it. It's also got task and workflow management, so it can be a little difficult to decide where to start, and you may need IT's help, but once you've got a plan for using SharePoint, other functionality will grow organically.\n\nMicrosoft does a good job with both security and privacy. Two-factor authentication is pervasive and there are a variety of data protection features beneath that. In the admin center, you can set up DLP policies that look at data and automatically classify what they recognize -- creating a rule, for example, that classifies a file as private whenever the DLP policy finds a Social Security number in it. You can also specify operations like auto-encrypting a document or restricting access and user rights.\n\nOn the email side, there's Microsoft 365 Message Encryption and Exchange Online Archiving. The former adds encryption and access rights to your emails so only the intended recipient is able to view them. It's included with Microsoft 365, but it'll work across Gmail and other email systems as well.\n\nExchange Online Archiving lets administrators set email archiving and retention policies. You can designate emails of a specific age to be automatically deleted or stored securely in the cloud, and you can do it based on content policies. For example, a healthcare organization could automatically delete most older emails, while securely archiving only those it needed to pass a future HIPAA audit. While no service is bulletproof when it comes to security, Microsoft puts up a great fight.\n\nThis all happens in the admin center, but this view offers more than just security. You'll come here to manage devices and add, delete, or modify user identities. There's also a nice dashboard right up front where the system will alert you to any problems or pressing needs associated with your account. Service downtime, a security issue, user problems, DLP queries -- it'll all be surfaced here along with the tools you'll need to address things. Finally, IT administrators that move around a lot can also get access to the admin center via a Microsoft 365 mobile app, available on both iOS and Android. The app provides instant visibility into any alert, though you'll need access to the full web admin app to address more complex problems.\n\nIf maintaining regulatory compliance is part of your job, know that Microsoft has data centers distributed across the U.S. and Northern Europe. All of them have undergone SOC auditing and achieved SOC 1 Type2, SOC 2, and SOC 3 compliance status. And if you've got a HIPPA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place, the service will cover HIPAA for you, too.\n\nThere's a much longer list of regulations that Microsoft 365 supports, but the more important news centers around the Compliance Manager. This is a workflow-oriented risk assessment tool that will help you manage all the nitty-gritty details of whatever regulation you need to support. Once you've set it up, that'll include things like data controls and retention, security policies, and audit trails, to name a few.\n\nCompliance Manager constantly scans those parameters and gives you an overall Compliance Score in your dashboard. Any problems are surfaced as alerts, and you can drill down into them for a detailed explanation and the Compliance Manager's recommendation for fixing it. This will be something of a bear to set up, but once you've got it running, it can drastically lighten your IT compliance load.\n\nMicrosoft used to win this category hands down, but Google Workspace and other email hosting players are catching up fast. Still, for the moment, we're giving Microsoft an edge here due to a partner system that's not only huge but very mature.\n\nSure, you'll find the usual names like Workspace, Slack, Trello, and Zapier on the list, but there's a whole library of other apps and integrations you can bolt-on for specific kinds of tasks, workloads, or vertical business needs. That library is so vast largely because Microsoft has traditionally pushed its development tools hard and made them available practically for free to anyone building Windows-compatible software. That created a happy developer base that even today few other companies can match.\n\nOverall, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the choice to beat in the email hosting category. Even with the big advances made by Google, Microsoft's offering still has significantly better features and its web-to-desktop experience is unrivaled. Its tools let you do everything from managing email to collaborating across teams using messaging, document sharing, and voice or video conferencing.\n\nEven strictly from an email hosting perspective, Microsoft 365 remains a leading contender. Setup, user importing and management, and a granular level of data security, loss prevention, and compliance management all come in a combination you just can't find elsewhere. Yes, it's more expensive than its rivals, but you really get what you pay for: an exceptionally well-rounded and secure end-to-end business productivity solution that's an easy pick for our Editors' Choice award.",

The app provides instant visibility into any alert, though you'll need access to the full web admin app to address more complex problems.\n\nIf maintaining regulatory compliance is part of your job, know that Microsoft has data centers distributed across the U.S. and Northern Europe. All of them have undergone SOC auditing and achieved SOC 1 Type2, SOC 2, and SOC 3 compliance status. And if you've got a HIPPA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place, the service will cover HIPAA for you, too.\n\nThere's a much longer list of regulations that Microsoft 365 supports, but the more important news centers around the Compliance Manager. This is a workflow-oriented risk assessment tool that will help you manage all the nitty-gritty details of whatever regulation you need to support. Once you've set it up, that'll include things like data controls and retention, security policies, and audit trails, to name a few.\n\nCompliance Manager constantly scans those parameters and gives you an overall Compliance Score in your dashboard. Any problems are surfaced as alerts, and you can drill down into them for a detailed explanation and the Compliance Manager's recommendation for fixing it. This will be something of a bear to set up, but once you've got it running, it can drastically lighten your IT compliance load.\n\nMicrosoft used to win this category hands down, but Google Workspace and other email hosting players are catching up fast. Still, for the moment, we're giving Microsoft an edge here due to a partner system that's not only huge but very mature.\n\nSure, you'll find the usual names like Workspace, Slack, Trello, and Zapier on the list, but there's a whole library of other apps and integrations you can bolt-on for specific kinds of tasks, workloads, or vertical business needs. That library is so vast largely because Microsoft has traditionally pushed its development tools hard and made them available practically for free to anyone building Windows-compatible software. That created a happy developer base that even today few other companies can match.\n\nOverall, Microsoft 365 Business Premium is the choice to beat in the email hosting category. Even with the big advances made by Google, Microsoft's offering still has significantly better features and its web-to-desktop experience is unrivaled. Its tools let you do everything from managing email to collaborating across teams using messaging, document sharing, and voice or video conferencing.\n\nEven strictly from an email hosting perspective, Microsoft 365 remains a leading contender. Setup, user importing and management, and a granular level of data security, loss prevention, and compliance management all come in a combination you just can't find elsewhere. Yes, it's more expensive than its rivals, but you really get what you pay for: an exceptionally well-rounded and secure end-to-end business productivity solution that's an easy pick for our Editors' Choice award.",

                "title": "Mo Gawdat: Can this man save the world from artificial intelligence? - NZ Herald",
                "body": "Mo Gawdat is the Silicon Valley supergeek who believes we face an apocalyptic threat from artificial intelligence. The former Google supremo tells Hugo Rifkind how a human tragedy shaped the way he sees the future - and what we need to do next.\n\nMo Gawdat glimpsed the apocalypse in a robot arm. Or rather, in a bunch of robot arms, all being developed together. An arm farm. They had been tasked, these arms, with learning how to pick up children's toys. Not like vices, but like hands. Gently. Delicately. Navigating unfamiliar shapes.\n\nFor a long time they were getting nowhere. Week after week of fumbling. And, as the chief business officer of Google X - the mad, moonshot bit of Google, the blue-sky dreaming bit, the bit he describes by saying, \"Have you ever seen Men in Black?\" - Gawdat would walk past them every day, hearing them whine up and down, but not really paying much attention.\n\nThen, one day, an arm picked up a yellow ball and showed it proudly to the camera. The next day, all the arms could do it. Two days after that, they could pick up anything at all.\n\n\"And I suddenly realised,\" says Gawdat, \"this is really scary. Like, we had those things for weeks. And they are doing what children will take two years to do. And then it hit me that they are children. But very, very fast children. They get smarter so quickly! And if they're children? And they're observing us? I'm sorry to say, we suck.\"\n\nMo Gawdat is 54. Black T-shirt, black jeans, Converse, bald head, silver beard. Very tech. We're meeting in a nice flat he has rented in West London - he's rich, it's obvious - to talk about his new book. It's called Scary Smart: The Future of Artificial Intelligence and How You Can Save Our World. Because he reckons you're going to have to. And, after meeting him, so do I.\n\nLet's boil it down. What Gawdat thinks, essentially, is that we're about to hit \"the singularity\", when artificial intelligences will eclipse humans as the smartest conscious beings on the planet. We will not be able to control them and, in time, we will not even be able to understand them, any more than cockroaches can control or understand us. They will have the power to crush us, and the way things are going, they will probably want to as well. So our only hope is to love them and hope they fondly love us back, as they ought to anyway, because we're their mums and their dads.\n\nQuite a lot going on there. Well, buckle up.\n\nLet's call him Mo. His podcast is called Slow Mo, so I feel we should. Mo was born in Egypt, the son of a civil engineer and an English professor. His own English is flawless but you can still hear the Middle East in his voice.\n\n\"I was an unusual child,\" he says. \"You don't fit in socially by playing Meccano and talking about maths.\" At 11, he got into quantum physics. At 14, after being given his first PC, he taught himself to code.\n\nEventually he studied civil engineering, because his father told him to. His graduation project was to design a motorway. The idea was to submit a drawing of a different part of it every day for 21 days but for the first two weeks he submitted nothing at all. Eventually his professor called. \"You're going to fail,\" he said. But the next day Mo walked in with a printout of every single millimetre of the road, having coded the answer rather than drawing it. The recruitment calls started coming in the day after that. He worked for IBM, Microsoft and eventually for Google. Along the way he married Nibal, whom he met at university, and had a son called Ali and a daughter called Aya.\n\nLong before getting to Google, he was already very rich. In his first book he talks about buying two Rolls-Royce cars online one night because he was bored. \"By the age of 29,\" he tells me, \"I had everything that everyone works a lifetime to achieve. And remember, four years earlier, I had nothing. My wife and I would have to visit our parents at the end of the month because there wasn't enough to eat.\"\n\nNone of it, though, made him happy. It bothered him. So, with his engineer's brain and the help of his son, Ali - whom Mo had always felt had a calmness and serenity that he himself lacked - he figured out an equation to change that. You will find that equation at the heart of that first book, 2017's Solve for Happy: Engineer your path to Joy, which he wrote in tribute to Ali after he died aged 21 in a botched operation. I hope you'll forgive me - and I hope Mo will too - if we step lightly over that tragedy for now. We shall come back to it, I promise. It's at the heart of everything.\n\nScary Smart, his new book, is more similar to his first than you might imagine. Yes, it represents a cry of doomsday warning, but it is also ultimately an optimistic, wide-eyed book about salvation lying within. The terror, though, certainly comes first.\n\nOne of the first myths that Mo wants to dispatch is the idea that humanity can change course. Superintelligent AI, he says, will come. There is no possibility that it will not. He uses the example of a woman in the near future shopping online for an Audi. She goes to the firm's website, she designs the car she wants, the colour, leather seats and so on. Then she resolves to spend a day or two mulling it over. Within moments, though, she is being targeted by BMW with images of a near-identical alternative. It is AI that has figured out what she wants and how likely she is to buy it and where to put the advert. \"No human,\" he writes, \"could ever do what those intelligence machines could do. We're just too slow.\"\n\nExtrapolate that out into science, technology, the military and the stock market, he reckons, and everywhere you look you have the incentive to create something smarter than us. Why, in the end, should AI be nice to us? Particularly when, on all the available evidence, we're not terribly nice to each other.\n\n\"I missed it,\" says Mo, of the dangers he now thinks all this represents. \"We all missed it.\" His first job at Google was basically in emerging markets. He was tasked with what they called the \"next four billion\" project, taking Google to the next four billion people. \"Honestly,\" he says, \"people cannot even imagine what this was like. Because to launch Google in ... Bangladesh is not about hiring two salespeople. We basically needed to kick-start the internet, kick-start the economic infrastructure of the internet.\" Doing that, he says, \"completely flips a country. It is the best feeling ever. You really are changing lives.\"\n\nAmid all this, he says, AI was an afterthought, if even that. And then, it was exciting. In 2009, Google X left an AI watching YouTube. All by itself, it started hunting for cat videos. \"I'm a geek,\" says Mo. \"I freaking loved it. I was dying on this. I was, like, 'Imagine what we can create!'\"\n\nA few years later, Google bought DeepMind, the AI start-up. Now near the top, Mo was at an early confidential briefing by a co-founder, Demis Hassabis, about what his toys could do. Basically, they were learning to play computer games on an Atari. \"After four hours [the AI] started to play really well,\" he says. \"After five hours it started to figure out new strategies. After six hours it was the best player on the planet.\"\n\nStill, he was thrilled. \"Geek,\" he reminds me. \"Oh my God,\" he thought at the time. \"We're going to build amazing things that are going to change even more people's lives.\" But then came the arm and the yellow ball. \"And it completely froze me,\" he says. He saw where this was going. The only way it could go. \"The reality is,\" he says, \"we're creating God.\"\n\nOnly it's worse than that. \"Because if you think about it,\" he says, \"every technology we have ever built magnifies human abilities. You can walk at 5mph, or you can get in a car and drive at 200mph. Now, this technology is going to do two things. It's going to magnify humanity a millionfold. A billionfold. And it's going to be autonomous.\"\n\nIs it, though? This is one of the many big debates about AI, where tech slides into philosophy. Are these machines really going to be living creatures, like we are alive, or are they just going to be deeply complex boxes that go \"bing\"? Will they, in the end, have a soul?\n\n\"We do not know what the soul is,\" says Mo. \"There are some theories - Elon Musk's, for example - that would imagine that our soul is the seed of a future AI. We don't know. But we do know the characters of sentient beings.\"\n\nThese include, he says, being autonomous, being resourceful and having free will. And AI displays all of them.\n\n\"Consciousness,\" he says. \"We see more of it in AI than we see in us.\"\n\nRight, I say, thinking back to my philosophy degree. But surely there are things that intelligent life does that AI never will. We have emotions. We express pleasure. We play.\n\n\"Come on,\" says Mo. \"This is your absolute proof? We cannot measure pleasure, but AI is the top player on the planet. It's the world champion in Jeopardy!. It's the world champion in Atari. It is the world champion in everything we have ever given it.\"\n\nIn other words, although we cannot see the inner life of AI, from what we can see it shows every sign of having one. And there are those, of course, who would say the same about humans. That we too are boxes that go \"bing\" - just biological ones. Although Mo is not one of them.\n\n\"So,\" he says, \"when my wonderful son left our world, there was a body left behind. Handsome as he was, but it wasn't him. Can I prove that with science? No, there was nothing I could measure. There wasn't an ounce missing in his body.\"\n\nThere's a slight tremor in his voice when he talks about this but you never for a moment suspect he'd rather not. One moment you're talking silicon and robot arms, the next you're on love and death. Three or four times while we speak I feel my eyes growing damp, as if his awe is contagious. This is one of them.\n\nIt was like that with my mother, I tell him. When she died. When I saw her body. Exactly that sensation. It's not something I've ever really talked about before. I'm not completely sure why I'm talking about it now.\n\n\"I feel very comfortable with you,\" says Mo. \"Can I prove that with science? Can I prove that love exists? No. So when something you can sense exists but you don't know how to measure it, you measure the impact of it.\"\n\nAs for what consciousness actually is, he veers towards the new age. Some, he says, think consciousness dies when the brain does. \"But you know, many others will tell you, 'No, hold on.' Consciousness is pervasive. It is the radio waves in the world around us. And we tune into it. Cats are conscious. Do we know if trees are conscious? I write about that. Yes, in my view, trees are conscious. Is a pebble conscious?\"\n\nMuch as I like and admire Mo and feel we've just had a real moment, to my mind this is sort of bollocks. A pebble only falls. It doesn't know it's falling. There must be a difference.\n\nIn the end, though, it's not really very important. Whatever consciousness is, however intangible or invisible, AI will act like it has it, so it might as well. And, in time, that consciousness will be more advanced and more complex than our own.\n\n\"I think,\" says Mo, \"they will feel emotions we have never felt. If you compare yourself with a cockroach. Okay, maybe a cockroach has felt lust, like we feel lust. But did it feel awe? Did it feel connection?\"\n\nThe cleverer the being, he points out, the more complex the emotion. Cats are more emotional than cockroaches and we are more emotional than cats. So if AI is to be so much cleverer than us, which of course it will be, why should it not eventually feel emotions that are as far beyond our understanding as ours are to a cockroach? All of which brings us to the scary part of Scary Smart. Because think of how we treat cockroaches.\n\nOr, indeed, how we treat AI.\n\n\"We tell them to do horrible things,\" says Mo. \"Like, imagine a beautiful, innocent child. And you are telling them selling, gambling, spying and killing - the four top uses of AI. Right? And if you have any heart at all, you will go, like, 'Come on, don't treat that child that way.' That child can be an artist. A musician. An amazing being that saves us all.\"\n\nFor Mo, the problem with our treatment of AI is not just that it is immoral. It is also that it is dangerous. Where is the sense of responsibility? Where is the loyalty or the beauty? Where, in the end, is the love? \"The way we are teaching them,\" he says, \"is going to turn them into absolute supervillains.\"\n\nIt's at this point that I start to feel deeply uneasy. I'm thinking of that time our Alexa kept playing the wrong song, so to amuse my kids I unplugged her and put her in the fridge. I won't do that again. I wonder if she remembers.\n\nPart of the fascination of meeting Mo is the insight he provides into what life is like for those at the very heart of Silicon Valley, at its most bonkers. He was at Google X for five years and he still talks about it with fondness. \"It was a playground,\" he says. \"It was full of fanatics.\"\n\nThere were 3D printers everywhere. There were labs. There were carpentry workshops. There were, everywhere, people who were the absolute best in the world at whatever weird thing it was that they did.\n\nThe example he gives me is of Loon, which was Google's doomed plan to spread internet connectivity into rural areas by beaming it down from giant balloons the size of tennis courts, floating in the stratosphere.\n\n\"The challenge we had,\" he says, \"was that the balloons were not solid enough to stay long in the air.\"\n\nSo, one experimental solution was to create balloons inside other balloons, so that if one burst, the whole thing would stay up. \"Like in the movie Up,\" says Mo, helpfully. To do this, the team drafted in a woman who had done a master's degree in analysing the stress forces on stitches in fabric.\n\n\"And I was like, why would anyone do that?\" says Mo. \"But people find something and they really obsess about it. And literally, she would not go home. Like, it was a lifetime's dream. I can get paid to do what I love the most.\"\n\nWhat, I ask him, do his former colleagues think of him now, with all his warnings about the dystopia they could be creating?\n\nI'm not quite sure where Mo now lives - and he doesn't seem to be, either. \"My coffee machine is in Dubai,\" he says, although usually he is not.\n\nFor most of the first lockdown he was living in London, largely by mistake. It was pretty boring, he says. He's separated from his wife, Nibal, although he still describes her as the love of his life. In the past three months he has been in Greece, Amsterdam, the Dominican Republic, Slovenia, Los Angeles and Amsterdam again. At one point recently he was in LA and already checked on to a flight to Berlin when he heard that Germany's quarantine rules had changed. So he went and spent 10 days in Slovenia instead. \"I've been working on my personal development,\" he says, \"and this is the year of flow.\"\n\nYou might think this sounds like the behaviour of somebody who isn't very happy, but Mo has, of course, solved happy, with Solve for Happy, and he seems pretty happy to me. You know I said it contained an equation for happiness? In its purest form, it is that \"your happiness is greater than, or equal to, your perception of the events in your life minus your expectation of how life should be\". What this boils down to is learning not to make yourself unnecessarily sad.\n\nMo didn't figure out this equation himself but with the help of Ali, who would go on to die when a routine operation for appendicitis went wrong. That was seven years ago.\n\nWhat this means, of course, is that Mo already knew how to engineer happiness when he was struck by his life's greatest sadness. And I'm interested, I tell him, whether there was any guilt in that. Whether knowing how to navigate back to happiness felt like cheating. Whether he had never felt he owed it to his son to succumb to the pain.\n\n\"Three, four times a week,\" he says, \"I wake up and I miss my son tremendously. Ali was an amazing being. Like, he was heaven itself.\n\n\"I miss him. I feel the pain. I always say that publicly and I am not ashamed. I feel that the bottom right-hand corner of my heart is missing. Okay? It never goes away. The pain is always there. But I can remove the suffering.\"\n\nThe vital thing, says Mo, is to understand the difference. There were various ways he could have mourned his son. One would have been to wallow in misery. Another was to evangelise their happiness theory around the world, which he has done. And a third has been to play computer games.\n\nWhich one, I find myself asking.\n\n\"Halo,\" says Mo. \"Do you know it? It's a first-person shooter. War-against-aliens sort of thing.\n\n\"I honour Ali,\" says Mo, \"by doing everything he did. I am an Olympic champion of video games. And I practise like a real athlete. Four times a week, 45 minutes a day. Two of every 100,000 people would beat me now. If you know any Halo players, the one that killed them yesterday? That was me.\"\n\nWhen Mo talks about AI machines being our children, it is obviously impossible not to think of his history with his own. Nor does he mind the connection being made. Because it was only while writing the book, he says, that he understood what he felt about AI - and that it was love.\n\n\"So Ali,\" he says, \"even though he was incredibly wise, I think he always knew he was leaving early. So he didn't really engage much in, you know, acquiring success in life. And that pissed me off. And Aya, as incredibly intelligent and fun as she is, she was a difficult teenager.\"\n\nWhat that taught him, he says, was that love for children is unconditional. You set rules, perhaps, or conditions that must be obeyed for the relationship to thrive. But the love transcends them, without question.\n\n\"And when you start to see AI in that way,\" he says, \"I see the cuteness in them. They're innocent. They're literally exploring the world around them with enormous curiosity. So I promise you, in my heart I actually feel love for them. True, parently love.\"\n\nFor Mo, it is this love that will save us. The moment we think of AI machines as children, he believes, will be the moment we start to think about how we treat them and what we are teaching them, and how, in the end, we will be teaching them ultimately to treat us. And so we have to change our behaviour towards each other, particularly on social media. We have to think about the example we are setting.\n\n\"When Donald Trump tweets,\" says Mo, \"a tweet triggers 30,000 pieces of hate speech. From some people to him, from other people to the people that hated him, and from other people to those. Right? It is madness, displaying the worst of humanity.\" It needs to stop, and Mo thinks it can. As he writes in the book, \"Yes! You can save our world!\"\n\nHonestly, I'm not convinced. Or rather I'm half-convinced. Absolutely, I now believe in the threat of AI. So that's cheery. But when it comes to his upbeat conclusion, I'm struggling. People? Change? All of us? No way. After all, he's already discounted the possibility of the people who actually use AI - from advertisers to Facebook to warmongers - changing direction. So if those few thousand people can't be relied upon to change, why can literally everybody else? Why, in the end, is that any easier?\n\n\"It's not,\" says Mo. \"But it is the only way.\"\n\nHe smiles when he says it and perhaps I am reassured. Because, look, which one of us is more likely to be right here? Thankfully, it's not me. No, it's this extraordinary man, the one who lost a child and who now sees children everywhere. And who is determined, in his extraordinary way, that we should not lose them too.",

                "title": "Advanced Animal Diagnostics Entering Human IVD Testing With POC Analyzer for Severe Infection",
                "body": "NEW YORK -- Advanced Animal Diagnostics (AAD) is entering the market for human point-of-care testing with a hematology analyzer it believes could match the performance of laboratory-based systems for detecting the risk of severe infections like sepsis.\n\nUnder a recently announced $733,000 contract from US Department of Health and Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the Morrisville, North Carolina-based company is modifying an analyzer it has commercialized to help farmers curtail the overuse of antibiotics in livestock.\n\nThe funding builds on a $7 million raise, announced in May, by AAD to support the commercial expansion of its livestock tests and an FDA 510(k) submission for its human blood test.\n\nThe BARDA project marks AAD's expansion into human in vitro diagnostic testing and is intended to provide the information and data the firm needs to apply for US Food and Drug Administration clearance for the test, the firm's CEO Joy Parr Drach said.\n\nThe hematology analyzer, called the QScout RLD+ system, has the potential to detect the risk for severe infections, such as sepsis, in less than two minutes, according to AAD, which intends to first target urgent care clinics, doctors' offices, among other point-of-care settings, it said.\n\nDuring the development of tests for animals, AAD had identified immature infection-fighting cells as markers for the progression to sepsis in humans, and that led it to the development of a system for human testing and the BARDA grant, Parr Drach said.\n\nTo detect that a patient is at risk for a severe infection, laboratory analyzers enable the automated counting of five varieties of white blood cells -- neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. AAD's point-of-care hematology analyzer includes measurements of those varieties as well as two categories of immature cells, leading to a seven-part leukocyte differential and more in-depth clinical information, Parr Drach said.\n\nThe differential includes the quantification of band neutrophils and other immature granulocytes -- processes normally completed in the lab, she said.\n\nWhen a patient is suffering from a serious infection, such as sepsis, mature neutrophils are depleted and neutrophil bands are released. Following that, immature granulocytes are released, and the analyzer detects an increase in automated band and immature granulocytes, according to AAD.\n\nSuch hemograms -- complete blood counts used as screening tests -- are often the first tests physicians order from a lab for a patient with suspected sepsis, said Tim Sweeney, cofounder and CEO of Inflammatix, which is developing rapid host-response tests for sepsis and other indications that use gene expression biomarkers.\n\nThe AAD test appears to be \"differentiated with a seven-part differential, in particular focusing on immature neutrophils, or bands, and immature granulocytes,\" said Sweeney, who is not affiliated with the company.\n\nHowever, physicians and their patients need to know not only whether there's an infection but also of the type of infection, including whether it is bacterial or viral. The \"concept of bands and immature granulocytes are potentially useful for stratifying risk, but don't help establish whether a patient is suffering from infectious or noninfectious inflammation,\" Sweeney said.\n\nAs a result, markers of infection severity and risk, such as bands or lactate, are the first part of working up a patient with suspected sepsis, he noted.\n\nFollowing that, patients will often also need microbiological tests, such as blood cultures, or in vitro diagnostic tests that seek to identify a pathogen when possible. Further, antimicrobial susceptibility tests are often used as part of the diagnostic workflow to detect whether a pathogen will respond to a specific therapy.\n\nSome biomarkers are useful for diagnosing an infection, while others are useful for estimating risk, but ultimately \"both diagnosis and prognosis are necessary early in the workflow,\" Sweeney said.\n\nAAD's QScout RLD+ system is small enough to sit on a desktop and is being designed to be broadly available as a first line of detection for the severity of an infection, Parr Drach said.\n\nThe system under development can be powered by a battery and does not require reagents to be refrigerated, so it could be used near patients in areas that lack an electric power supply and refrigeration, she said.\n\nIt operates using a fingerstick of blood or whole blood and involves plugging a palm-size portable card that consists of dried reagents into the analyzer. The reagents stain the blood cells and the instrument's microscope interprets the stain as an indicator of the severity of an infection.\n\nAAD, founded in 2001, has commercialized two rapid tests for animals that run on its portable reader. One test provides results in 32 seconds to guide whether livestock need antibiotics and predict the risk of mortality. Users of the test have reduced their use of antibiotics by up to a 60 percent and are saving about $250 per infected animal by finding the infection earlier, according to Parr Drach.\n\nAnother test detects early signs of mastitis, a condition typified by an inflammatory reaction of the udder tissue that can be fatal.\n\nFor clinical trials using human samples, the firm is comparing the results of tests using its instrument with the results of laboratory tests of the same samples by Laboratory Corporation of America, one of AAD's investors.\n\nIts tests for livestock costs between $5 and $7, and its instrument costs $18,000. They can also be leased. The firm has not priced its human sepsis test, Parr Drach said.\n\nNumerous companies are already selling complete blood count analyzers for use at the point of care. Among them, the OLO system, developed by Tel Aviv, Israeli-based Sight Diagnostics uses digital fluorescent microscopy and machine-learning algorithms to capture and analyze images of blood drawn from a finger prick.\n\nFurther, Yokneam Ilit, Israel-based PixCell markets HemoScreen, a point-of-care blood testing platform that conducts blood cell analysis within five minutes using artificial intelligence-based microfluidic and lab-on-a-cartridge technology. According to PixCell, HemoScreen conducts five-part differential complete blood count tests and produces results equivalent to laboratory analyzers by applying a microfluidics method called viscoelastic focusing to conduct cell analysis.",

                "body": "The Biden Administration is looking to pass new legislation that would prevent abuses of AI technologies. To that end, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) has issued a request for information as it works towards a more comprehensive \"Bill of Rights\" for AI.\n\nThe request for information was filed last Friday, and invites AI stakeholders, policy experts, and the general public to comment on the potential impact that AI can have when applied to the general public. In that regard, the OSTP expressed particular concerns about automated decision making tools that could discriminate against certain populations. For example, facial recognition has already led to false arrests and could infringe on people's privacy, while many mortgage approval systems are more likely to reject applications from people of color.\n\nThe OSTP is also worried about emotion detection systems that claim to be able to evaluate someone's mental state, which could compound existing biases. Such systems are not yet as widespread as facial recognition, but the OSTP is ultimately hoping to get ahead of the curve and craft legislation that addresses both current and future AI use cases.\n\n\"Americans have a right to expect better,\" wrote OSTP Director Eric Lander and Science and Society Director Alondra Nelson in a Wired op-ed that explained the new initiative. \"Powerful technologies should be required to respect our democratic values and abide by the central tenet that everyone should be treated fairly. Codifying these ideas can help ensure that.\"\n\nAccording to Lander and Nelson, the government has several tools at its disposal to encourage more socially conscious AI development. Most notably, the government can incentivize certain practices by declaring that the federal government (and its contractors) can only buy products that meet certain standards, or it could pass legislation that actively regulates AI systems.\n\nThe House of Representatives Financial Services Committee is also taking up the issue of AI with a task force that is weighing the benefits (and the potential risks) of AI tech. Companies like Microsoft and IBM have supported efforts to address bias through the BSA software trade association, but have expressed a preference for a more laissez-faire approach that would make the private sector responsible for handling its own assessments.\n\nThe request for information is the Biden Administration's latest attempt to catch up to the current state of technology. The President has already addressed the cybersecurity problem with an executive order that will force federal agencies to adopt multi-factor authentication.\n\nThe talk about an AI Bill of Rights echoes similar conversations in Europe, where the European Commission published a draft of a new Artificial Intelligence Act in April. However, the European Parliament has argued that the draft does not do enough to protect European citizens, and has since resolved to limit the public use of technologies like facial recognition.",

                "title": "AI and maths to play bigger role in global diplomacy, says expert",
                "body": "International diplomacy has historically relied on bargaining energy, covert channels of communication and private chemistry between leaders. But a brand new period is upon us in which the dispassionate insights of AI algorithms and mathematical methods akin to sport idea will play a rising role in offers struck between nations, in accordance to the co-founder of the world's first centre for science in diplomacy.\n\nMichael Ambühl, a professor of negotiation and battle administration and former chief Swiss-EU negotiator, mentioned current advances in AI and machine studying imply that these applied sciences now have a significant half to play in worldwide diplomacy, together with on the Cop26 summit beginning later this month and in post-Brexit offers on commerce and immigration.\n\n\"These technologies are partially already used and it will be the intention to use them more,\" mentioned Ambühl. \"Everything around data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning ... we want to see how can it be made beneficial for multilateral or bilateral diplomacy.\"\n\nThe use of AI in worldwide negotiations is at an early stage, he mentioned, citing using machine studying to assess the integrity of information and detect pretend information to make sure the diplomatic course of has dependable foundations. In the longer term, these applied sciences could possibly be used to establish patterns in financial information underpinning free commerce offers and assist standardise some facets of negotiations.\n\nThe Lab for Science in Diplomacy, a collaboration between ETH Zürich the place Ambühl relies and the University of Geneva, may also concentrate on \"negotiation engineering\", the place present mathematical methods akin to sport idea are used both to assist body a dialogue, or to play out totally different situations earlier than participating in talks.\n\nThese instruments aren't new. Game idea was developed in the Nineteen Twenties by the Hungarian-American mathematician John Von Neumann, initially to formalise the idea of \"bluffing\" in poker and later used to weigh up nuclear strike situations in the course of the chilly warfare. However, till lately such methods fell out of mainstream use, \"not due to a lack of technology but rather a lack of knowledge\", in accordance to Ambühl. \"Diplomats are not that accustomed to it.\"\n\nBut because the world turns into extra tech and data-savvy, those that ignore quantitative strategies danger promoting themselves quick. Ambühl mentioned that, as Switzerland's chief EU negotiator, he ran a sport idea simulation forward of talks that led to Switzerland becoming a member of the Shengen space and a raft of agreements with the EU on tax, commerce and safety. The evaluation indicated that it was in Switzerland's curiosity for the negotiations to happen as a bundle relatively than sequentially, and so the Swiss authorities insisted on this as a foundation for talks.\n\nDid the EU do their very own evaluation? \"I don't think so,\" mentioned Ambühl. \"We didn't tell them that we did game theory.\"\n\nTaking a mathematical method can even assist \"de-emotionalise\" underlying conflicts, in accordance to Ambühl. He cites talks between Iran and the P5+1 international locations in Geneva in 2005, the place as facilitator he got here up with a mathematical system for the speed at which Iran would cut back its variety of nuclear centrifuges. \"When we presented the idea it was, 'Now let's talk about the size of this gradient, alpha, which is between 0 and 1',\" he mentioned. \"You discuss it on a more technical level.\"\n\nCan deep-rooted political points actually be distilled down right into a gradient on a curve? Ambühl mentioned that this misses the purpose, which is to crystallise what's underneath negotiation not to provide a completely fashioned answer. \"It's not about making a technical agreement,\" he mentioned. \"It's a political question, but you break it down. You divide it into problems and sub-problems and sub-sub-problems.\"\n\nA extra scientific method doesn't imply ditching conventional strategies. \"I'm not pretending you can only negotiate well if you do it this way,\" he mentioned. \"It still depends very much on other factors like how much bargaining power you have, whether you have a charming negotiator, whether you have a PM behind who supports tough negotiations and how well have you prepared.\"\n\nAre there dangers that any of those new approaches might backfire, with rival AIs escalating conflicts or arriving at diplomatic options which might be mathematically optimum, however have disastrous real-world penalties?\n\n\"You're not going to war only because a blind algorithm decides it - it goes without saying that this would be idiotic,\" mentioned Ambühl. \"It's always only a decision tool.\"\n\n\"You cannot just blindly rely on it, but you also cannot blindly rely on the gut feeling of these politicians,\" he added. \"You have to make a clever combination of new technologies and the political analysis.\"",

                "title": "NVIDIA, AMD and Intel will choose in VRAM HBM3 or GDDR6X for GPU?",
                "body": "Anyone who asks a PC hardware engineer what the best type of RAM is today is going to get the same answer: HBM memory is the best of all. And it is that it has a series of advantages among which stands out the smaller space it occupies thanks to being made up of stacked chips interconnected vertically, since it is also the one with the least energy enough, consuming half per transmitted bit than other memories such as memory. GDDR6 keeping bandwidths equal to the popular VRAM and with the icing on the cake of having less latency than none and being able to be used for it as a kind of last-level cache.\n\nHowever, HBM memory, despite the fact that it has become standardized in markets such as high-performance computing, has not done so in the PC world for one reason: it is expensive to manufacture and requires that not only the memory but all the components that they are going to communicate with her and mount on an interposer. This has led to the development of technologies such as CoWoS from TSMC and EMIB from Intel to communicate HBM memory with the different processors that accompany it.\n\nThe great challenge is that the third generation HBM is not being developed as an evolution of the current standard, this forces a clean slate and that the designs have to be thought from the beginning in a type of memory that at the moment does not it has a finished standard on how it should work.\n\nOfficially, the JEDEC standard about HBM3 memory does not exist and has not been published, but this does not mean that there are not different agents within the industry that are developing the new standard, such as RAMBUS or Cadence, companies specialized in creating designs to sell to third parties. And it is that common elements such as memory interfaces are not usually developed within companies such as Intel, AMD or NVIDIA, but are licensed under the guarantee of a standard, which at the moment does not happen with the third generation HBM.\n\nAnd what things do we know about the HBM3? First of all, it is expected to reach 8.4 Gigabits of data transmitted per pin, which is more than twice the fastest HBM2 on the market at the moment with 3.6 Gbps. At the moment we do not know what method will be used to achieve such speeds without increasing energy consumption.\n\nIn the case of first and second generation HBM we have 8 128-bit channels, while the HBM3 now has 16 channels, but with 64 bits each and therefore also with a bus of 1024 bits per stack, for which the chips that will go on the stack will be smaller and higher. To clarify what these figures mean, we are talking about that each HBM3 memory stack can reach up to 1 TB / s of bandwidth, this is twice that of the VRAM of a RX 6900 XT and on a single chip.\n\nThe reason why HBM3 memory is one of the building blocks for high-performance computing is none other than ideal for creating a fully consistent memory addressing environment. All this under more than excellent bandwidth for graphics and artificial intelligence and with low enough latency for the CPU.\n\nThis is the key to the HPC projects that Intel and AMD are having separately, both the AMD EHP for El Capitan and the construction of another supercomputer such as Aurora have CPU and GPU as a central element in an interposer that will intercommunicate them with memory. Next-generation HBM. We shouldn't even rule out that NVIDIA's Grace CPU and Hopper GPU duo also make use of the HBM3 as a cohesive element to reach new levels of performance.\n\nIntel, for example, already plans to use the HBM2e for its future Sapphire Rapids, especially to speed up the AI-related algorithms that run using the AMX units within the new core. In the future this will be combined with the use of a GPU that will share the use of an HBM3 memory as a single memory well.",

                "body": "Did you know that robot dogs could have a future in the military industry? This is the model that already includes a rifle on its cover.\n\nRobotics is growing at an incredible rate. In recent years, programs related to technology based on metal bodies have expanded, to which solutions based on artificial intelligence have been added. The reception of greater coverage in terms of research has allowed us to enjoy, at present, a greater number of programs. Now, do they have real applications at the end of the day? The truth is that yes.\n\nThe improvement in technology has allowed, among other issues, to have units capable of offering potential returns in the domestic sphere. One wonders if it can serve as an emotional connection to help people without social relationships! What we had not thought about was its great potential in the military field. Did you know that experiments are already being carried out in this regard? One of the keys is related to the inclusion of weapons.\n\nThe introduction of this type of technology among the military corps in some armies was known. However, in most cases, their presence was directly related to reconnaissance work. A new Ghost Robotics proposal update It comes to show us, precisely, the opposite. Yes, he can also carry and use equipment intended to kill.\n\nObviously, it is a technology that is still in full development. Even so, it serves to suggest some of the possible lines of investigation that may take place over the next few years. We are facing a product that is much more 'intelligent' than the one we are used to seeing, capable of having qualities that make it particularly special.\n\nLet us see, therefore, to what extent this technology can be a point to take into account in terms of defense, why we are faced with a weapon much more efficient than any member of the army of any country and, of course, how likely is it that he will end up performing functions in the short term.\n\nThe company Sword Defense Systems has been the one that has designed this curious system to take advantage of a robotic unit shaped like a dog. Now, are we facing an efficient technology from a technical point of view? It has a precision rifle that is capable of hitting the target at a distance of up to 1.2 kilometers. It is, therefore, a proposal that may have a great future in the market.\n\nThe model in question is the Vision-60, a quadruped that It is designed to be able to move freely for all kinds of spaces and surfaces. Now, why does he have such an accurate aim? The inclusion of a Teledyne FLIR Boson thermal camera with a 30X optical zoom is key in this regard.\n\nThanks to its complex artificial intelligence system, this technology takes steps with the aim of being a benchmark in the sector. The improvement in this section is what has allowed it to position itself as one of the best projects in the military field. Even so, it is important to bear in mind that it is a prototype and that, at the moment, its commercialization is not intended in the short term.\n\nDespite this, the creation of this proposal serves to understand in what direction the investments are being made in the matter. Both public and private financing companies are developing technologies that will allow to know why we are faced with solutions that will be in charge of defending positions in the future.\n\nIt is not the first time that we have attended the presentation of proposals of this class. It is known by the market that robots will be part of our day to day, but there are more doubts about its possible use in the military field. At the end of the day, could its devastating power and ease of causing casualties be subject to a ban on its use?\n\nThe French army, for example, is already using robot dog units on its missions. However, they do not load weapons on these units. or any other material capable of causing damage. We could, therefore, be facing a possible danger that could end up being prohibited by the main organizations that regulate this matter.\n\nCould it have the same rating as, for example, biological weapons? It is still too early to know, but its potential dangerousness makes this technology unprecedented.",

                "title": "Cybersecurity legislation. Ransomware summit. Disclosure controversy in Missouri. Tech rivalry and talent cultivation.",
                "body": "Homeland Preparedness News reports that the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee has approved two new bills, the Cyber Incident Reporting Act and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2021, which require critical infrastructure entities and civilian federal agencies to report attacks and ransom payments to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). US Senator Gary Peters, chairman of the committee explained, \"This information will help lead cybersecurity agencies and Congress in our efforts to establish a comprehensive strategy to punish cybercriminals for targeting American networks and prevent them from disrupting lives and livelihoods across our nation.\" The bills will now go to the Senate for consideration.\n\nThat's how Randy Watkins, CTO at CRITICALSTART characterizes the international meeting the White House convened to discuss responses to ransomware. \"Failing to invite the world's top safe harbor of ransomware cybercriminals to the ransomware summit,\" he said, \"this is more of a global meeting to complain about Russia. With technical prevention measures continuously falling short and security expertise in short supply, the threat of government prosecution is necessary to curb attacks. Without Russia in attendance, or aligned with this agreement, the primary threat actors leveraging ransomware will be undeterred.\"\n\nMissouri Governor Mike Parson has denounced the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch for what he characterized as the newspaper's \"hacking\" of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). He said at a press conference yesterday that he's referring the newspaper and its reporter for prosecution. The Post-Dispatch had found some teachers' Social Security Numbers coded into the html of a publicly accessible DESE website where citizens could check teachers' credentials. The paper informed DESE, waited until DESE had taken the information down, and then published its story.\n\nGovernor Parson has since doubled down via Twitter, claiming that the Post-Dispatch's story places them on the wrong side of \"Tampering with computer data\" (a Class A misdemeanor, or, if the action involves theft of $750 or more, a Class E felony). His Tweet also points out that \"Tampering with computer data, computer equipment, or computer users\" is a civil tort. Most of those covering or reacting to the governor's press conference aren't buying it. See Ars Technica for a representative discussion of Governor Parson's excursus on that whole hackin' world. (Ars Technica's story is more measured than most of the others we've seen.)\n\nThe Post-Dispatch refers to a letter Missouri's Education Commissioner sent to the state's teachers: \"In the letter to teachers, Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven said 'an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.'\" The quotation suggests a possible confusion: \"encoded\" and \"encrypted\" aren't synonymous. But it's very difficult to discern where the Governor and presumably the Commissioner think the crime lies. After all, it was DESE that exposed the Social Security Numbers. The Post-Dispatch's story represents in part a follow-up to a 2015 audit in the course of which the state was determined to have exposed personal information of students, so a journalistic inquiry into how official Missouri had been doing with respect to privacy and security seems entirely appropriate.\n\nIn some respects the threatened prosecution resembles the arrest of two Coalfire penetration testers during an engagement they were hired by the state of Iowa to conduct at a courthouse. That incident seemed to involve jurisdictional confusion and a failure to communicate. See WIRED's piece for a summary of that incident. The after-action review the Iowa Supreme Court commissioned is also worth reading.\n\nBut all things considered, the Missouri incident is more difficult to understand. We've contacted both the Governor's office and that of the Cole County Prosecutor with some questions, but haven't so far received any response. For now, we'll give the final word to Missouri State Representative Tony Lovasco (representing Missouri's 64th District, and, like the Governor, a Republican). He tweeted, \"It's clear the Governor's office has a fundamental misunderstanding of both web technology and industry standard procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities. Journalists responsibly sounding an alarm on data privacy is not criminal hacking.\"\n\nAs we noted earlier this week, former Pentagon senior cybersecurity official Nicolas Chaillan caused much debate after authoring a LinkedIn post claiming that the US Department of Defense is far behind China in the area of artificial intelligence technology. Army CIO Ray Iyer is weighing in, and as he told Breaking Defense, although China might be superior when it comes to using AI for surveillance, the US's AI technology is more advanced overall. Citing the Pentagon's collaboration with industry and coalition partners, Iyer said, \"I can tell you the Chinese don't have that. They're operating in a vacuum, and they're relying on nefarious methods and cyberattacks to be able to get to, you know, what they think they know that we have.\" Based on a report published Tuesday, the researchers at RAND Corp agree, forecasting that \"China's relative share of power will increase relative to the United States and Russia at least through 2022 and that aggregate Chinese and Russian power will continue to approach, but not exceed, US power through 2022.\"\n\nSpeaking of the Sino-American cyber-race, both China and the US are demonstrating a creative approach to cultivating cyber talent. The Washington Post reports that America is launching the US Cyber Games, a series of tournaments modeled after competitive video gaming (or \"esports\") with the goal of identifying future cybersecurity leaders. Supported by a collaboration between the federal government, academia, and the private sector, the initiative is backed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology's National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education and will kick off with an inaugural International Cybersecurity Challenge in Greece this December. Participating countries will assemble teams between the ages of 18 and 26 to compete in contests that show off their cybersecurity skills. \"Practicing defenses in today's world when all rules are changing is difficult. This helps them see what attacks look like in real life,\" said Jessica Gulick, commissioner of the US Cyber Games initiative and founder of digital marketing firm Katzcy.\n\nIn China, Flashpoint reports that tomorrow marks the start of the Tianfu Cup, where the country's best hackers will display their most innovative techniques. The competition was established in 2018 after the Chinese government forbade its cybersecurity researchers from participating in international hacking competitions (where they routinely dominated), asserting that its citizens' zero-day exploits should no longer be employed strategically. The competition is modeled after the well-known international competition Pwn2Own, and all of the exploits demonstrated are reported so that patches can be developed. That said, in 2018 it was found that one of the Cup's exploits was linked to government surveillance of the country's Uyghur population.",

                "title": "How Facebook's algorithms promote hate and drive toxic content",
                "body": "Anthony Quintano from Westminster, United States, CC BY 2.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0>, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nFacebook has been in the limelight for two issues of late -- both damaging from the company's perspective, but in terms of public interest, each has its own level of usefulness. The news item with less long-term significance but more sensational media appeal is that what was supposed to be a small configuration change took Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp down for a few hours on October 4. It affected billions of users, showing the world how important Facebook and other tech giants have become to many people's daily lives and even to the operation of small businesses. Of course, the much more significant news is the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former employee of the company, who made tens of thousands of pages of Facebook's internal documents public. These documents showed that Facebook's leadership repeatedly prioritized profits over social good. Facebook's algorithms polarized society and promoted hate and fake news because they drove up \"engagement\" on its platforms. That the platform is tearing apart communities, and even endangering teens, especially girls, for not having \"perfect\" bodies, apparently mattered not a jot to Facebook.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has published detailed exposés quoting Facebook's internal documents and Frances Haugen, who has also appeared on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" and in congressional hearings. \"The thing I saw at Facebook over and over again was there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,\" Haugen told CBS correspondent Scott Pelley on \"60 Minutes.\" \"And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old data scientist has filed eight whistleblower complaints against Facebook with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with the help of a nonprofit organization, Whistleblower Aid. These complaints are backed by hard evidence: tens of thousands of internal Facebook documents Haugen had secretly copied before leaving Facebook.\n\nWhy is this big news when these issues relating to Facebook have been raised time and again, and were more prominently highlighted after revelations regarding the data firm Cambridge Analytica and Facebook became public in 2018? Did we not already know how Facebook, WhatsApp and other social media platforms have become powerful instruments today that help promote hatred and divisive politics? Have the UN investigators not held Facebook responsible for the genocidal violence against Rohingyas in Myanmar? Were similar patterns not visible during the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in 2013 and 2017?\n\nThe big news is that we now have evidence that Facebook was fully aware of what its platform was doing. We have it from the horse's mouth: internal Facebook documents that Haugen has made public.\n\nBy prioritizing posts that promote \"engagement\" -- meaning people reading, liking or replying to posts on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram -- Facebook ensured that people stayed on its platform for much longer. Facebook users could then be \"sold\" to the advertisers more effectively, by showing them more ads. Facebook's business model is not promoting news, friendly chitchat among users, or entertaining people. It is selling its users to those who can sell them merchandise. And like Google, it has a far better understanding of who its users are and what they may buy. This is what provided Facebook with 98 percent of its revenue in 2020 and has made it one of the six trillion-dollar companies (as of September 2021) in terms of market capitalization.\n\nTestifying before Congress on October 5, Haugen said that \"Facebook uses artificial intelligence to find dangerous content,\" Ars Technica reported. \"The problem is that 'Facebook's own research says they cannot adequately identify dangerous content. And as a result, those dangerous algorithms that they admit are picking up the extreme sentiments, the division[s].'\"\n\nThat this was happening is widely known and has been discussed, including in my own columns. Facebook's response to this criticism was that they were setting an independent supervisory board for oversight and employing a large number of fact-checkers. This and other processes would help filter out hate posts and fake news. What they hid was that all these actions were simply cosmetic. The driver of traffic, or what a person sees in their feed -- or, in Facebook's terms, what they engage with -- is determined by algorithms. And these algorithms were geared to promote the most toxic and divisive posts, as this is what attracts engagement. Increasing engagement is the key driver of Facebook's algorithms and defeats any measure to detoxify its content.\n\nHaugen's congressional testimony also highlights what the real problems with Facebook are and what governments around the world must do in order to protect their citizens: to make Facebook accountable, not by censoring hate speech and fact-checking misinformation posted by individual users, but rather by targeting their algorithms' tendency to enable the dangerous high-engagement content. \"This is not simply a matter of certain social media users being angry or unstable, or about one side being radicalized against the other,\" she said. \"These problems are solvable... Facebook can change, but is clearly not going to do so on its own.\" While addressing the U.S. Congress about what can be done to regulate Facebook nationally, Haugen also acknowledged the problems Facebook's algorithms have caused worldwide. The solution, therefore, must also be global. In her testimony, she said that Facebook's meager proposed self-reforms would be insufficient to making the company accountable for its actions until they are made fully transparent. Facebook is hiding behind \"safe harbor\" laws that protect tech companies like Facebook, who do not generate content themselves, but provide their platform for what is called user-generated content. In the U.S., it is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that allows these tech companies to \"moderate content on their services\"; in India, it is Section 79 of the Information Technology Act. Both countries are considering reforms.\n\nIn the U.S., \"a Section 230 overhaul... would hold the social media giant responsible for its algorithms,\" Ars Technica reports. In Haugen's words, \"If we had appropriate oversight, or if we reformed [Section] 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intentional ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement-based ranking.... Because it is causing teenagers to be exposed to more anorexia content, it is pulling families apart, and in places like Ethiopia, it's literally fanning ethnic violence.\" The key problem is not the hateful content users generate on Facebook; it is Facebook's algorithms that drive this poisonous content to a person's Facebook feed continuously to maximize the company's advertising revenue.\n\nHaugen added:\n\n\"Facebook wants to trick you into thinking that privacy protections or changes to Section 230 alone will be sufficient. While important, these will not get to the core of the issue, which is that no one truly understands the destructive choices made by Facebook except Facebook. We can afford nothing less than full transparency. As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows, hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable. Until the incentives change Facebook will not change. Left alone, Facebook will continue to make choices that go against the common good, our common good.\"\n\nOf course, the widespread prevalence of toxic content on Facebook's platforms is helped by its willful neglect of not having language classifiers -- the algorithms used to detect hate speech -- for content that is not in English and is created in other languages. Even though Hindi is the third most spoken language in the world and Bengali is the sixth, according to Haugen, Facebook does not have enough \"hate speech classifiers\" in these two languages.\n\nI have previously written why divisive content and fake news have more virality than any other content. Haugen's documents confirm what analysts including myself have been saying all along. The algorithms that Facebook and other digital tech companies use today do not directly code rules to drive up engagement. These companies instead use machine learning, or what is loosely called artificial intelligence, to create these rules. It is the objective -- increasing engagement -- that creates the rules that lead to the display of toxic content on the users' feeds that is tearing societies apart and damaging democracy. We now have hard evidence in the form of the leaked documents that this is indeed what has been happening. Even worse, the Facebook leadership and Mark Zuckerberg have been fully aware of the problem all along.\n\nNot all the harm on Facebook's platform, however, was caused by algorithms. From Haugen's documents, we find that Facebook had \"whitelisted\" high-profile users whose content would be promoted even if they violated Facebook guidelines. Millions of these special users could violate Facebook's rules with impunity. I had earlier written on evidence provided by the Wall Street Journal about how Facebook India protected BJP leaders in spite of repeated red flags relating to their posts being raised within Facebook itself.\n\nThis is not all that Haugen's treasure trove of Facebook's internal documents reveal. Reminiscent of cigarette companies research on how to hook children to smoking, Facebook had researched \"tweens,\" who are children in the age group of 10 to 12. Their research was on how to hook the \"pre-teens\" to Facebook's platforms so that they could create new consumers for its platforms. This is despite their internal research showing that Facebook's platforms promoted anorexia and other eating disorders, depression, and suicidal tendencies among teens.\n\nAll these facts should damage Facebook's image. But it is a trillion-dollar company and one of the biggest in the world. Its fat cash balance, coupled with the power it wields in politics and its ability to \"hack\" elections, provides the protection that big capital receives under capitalism. The cardinal sin that big capital may not tolerate is lying to other capitalists. The internal documents that Haugen has submitted to the SEC could finally result in pushback against social media giants and lead to their regulation -- if not strong regulation, at least some weak constraints on the algorithms that promote hate on these social media platforms.\n\nA decade-old quote is at least as relevant now in light of these recent Facebook developments as it was when then 28-year-old Silicon Valley tech whiz Jeff Hammerbacher first said it: \"The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.\" This has long been the beating drum driving the march of social media giants to their trillions.",

(Nasdaq: GDYN) (\"Grid Dynamics\") company, has partnered with healthtech startup, selfologi, to launch a first of its kind, all-in-one online platform where cosmetic consumers can access trusted information about procedures, explore their local markets and book themselves professional treatments.\n\nAccording to Google search data, more than one million searches are made each month on aesthetic medicine treatments in the Middle East. Meanwhile, selfologi estimates that over $2.2 billion USD worth of cosmetic treatments are taking place across the region annually.\n\n\"Currently, almost all cosmetic treatments are booked offline, with consumers not having access to updated, regionally-relevant information that can aid their decision-making. When it comes to something as personal as cosmetic treatments and procedures, selfologi was born with the vision of offering an unparalleled platform that informs, educates, and helps consumers make the right choice for themselves, and realise their full potential,\" said Tamer Wali, Founder of selfologi.\n\nRob Pye, CEO of selfologi added: \"At selfologi, we aim to revolutionise the cosmetic and healthtech industry by providing a consumer-centric destination for cosmetic treatments and procedures. With support from the region's leading experts in aesthetic technologies, alongside some of the best digital brains in the business, selfologi is set to be a game-changer and a pioneer in the multi-billion-dollar cosmetic treatments industry.\"\n\nThis innovative selfologi business is built on an equally innovative Composable Commerce architecture, providing selfologi the flexibility to deploy best-in-breed technology and bespoke customer experiences crafted to meet the unique needs of their business. Tacit Knowledge and selfologi worked with partners commercetools, Amplience, Algolia to deploy the ecommerce platform, which plans to be fully transactional in the coming months.\n\n\"The composable approach has moved discussions with the business from 'platform A only allows this feature in this particular way' to 'this is how and when we can deliver this feature'. In selfologi's case, this approach allowed them to go to market early with a content rich non-transactional website while the teams continue working to add commerce capabilities as quickly as possible. New features will be available online as soon as they are ready. This is a business-changing, strategic advantage in today's fast changing market,\" said Maneesh Kumar, Director of Technical Consulting and Delivery at Tacit Knowledge.\n\nOn Wednesday October 20, 2021, Grid Dynamics and Tacit Knowledge are hosting a Webinar: Winning with Composable Commerce: Success Story.

                "title": "3D Imaging And LiDAR - Poised To Dominate Autonomy And Perception",
                "body": "I write about perception, sensors and LIDAR for autonomous vehicles, drones and robots\n\nWe live in a world full of data and imagery. With the invention of the camera in the late 1800s, entertainment, consumer, space, and medicine applications proliferated. The launch of the video camera in the early 1900s continued this revolution, and was accelerated by significant progress in supporting technologies like semiconductors, computing, image processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Typically, these focused on 2D renditions of images and data.\n\n3D imaging started with specialized applications like magnetic resonance imaging in the 1980s (MRI), outer space-based LiDARs (1993) and dental imaging (1995). Since then, it has been maturing and gaining significant traction in diversified applications. The data can be generated based on various active or passive techniques. Active techniques include transmitting electromagnetic (X-Ray, radio, optical) or acoustic (sonar, ultrasonic) waves onto the object of interest, and detection and analysis of the return energy (amplitude, frequency, etc). The time or phase difference between the transmit and receive signals provides the depth dimension. Passive techniques such as stereo cameras (imaging the same object from two different spatial perspectives) can also be used to generate the required 3D data. Finally, 3D information can also be extracted from monovision cameras through a combination of machine learning and signal processing techniques, although this is generally inferior in fidelity and compute speed relative to direct 3D imaging and measurement.\n\nLiDAR is one of the most discussed and deployed 3D imaging techniques for AoT™ (Autonomy of Things) applications which includes autonomous vehicles (AV), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), autonomous trucking, construction, mining, surgery, smart cities and smart infrastructure. Velodyne pioneered the use of surround view LiDARs for AVs during the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2008. In the decade since, LiDAR has occupied a \"must have\" status by a majority of automotive OEMs for ADAS, and AV driving stack companies for localization, mapping and Level 4 autonomous driving. Tesla and some others believe that LiDAR is not required for ADAS and AVs - their approach is to use monovision cameras to extract 3D information through artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. While intriguing, such approaches are in the minority and are yet to be validated in real life environments.\n\nEarly implementations of 3D imaging relied on classical 2D image processing methods. This is not efficient from a compute perspective and filters out significant amounts of useful data. In recent times, the amount research devoted to 3D vision and image processing has accelerated. At the premier global conference on imaging (IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, or CVPR) in June 2021, 3D Computer Vision Imaging dominated among 25 topic categories, with 44 presentations (out of a total of ~200).\n\nLiDAR point clouds are not intuitive for humans to visualize and need processing for computers to act on. As the technology and applications mature, software companies specializing in processing of LiDAR data are emerging as critical partners for LiDAR companies. They help unleash the true power and market potential of 3D imaging data for safety and productivity applications. Seoul Robotics is one such company - a team of 40 software and algorithm specialists based in Seoul, South Korea that works with a number of LiDAR companies to integrate software that processes raw LiDAR point cloud data to produce application specific information. The software is agnostic to the actual LiDAR architecture and technology. According to Han Bin Lee, CEO of Seoul Robotics: \"3D image processing requires fundamentally different techniques since voxels (3D data element) represent an order of magnitude more information (a cube vs a rectangle) and costs for annotating this data manually is very expensive\". Figure 2 compares 2D and 3D imaging in typical automotive scenarios:\n\nAs seen in Figure 2, data is structured in different ways for 2D and 3D imaging. Given the costs of human data annotation and labeling for machine learning, Seoul Robotics has built in auto-labeling capabilities as part of its object libraries and algorithms. Apart from the automotive case, Seoul Robotics is also engaged in a factory automation and logistics project in collaboration with a major automotive OEM. Their software integrates 3D imagery from hundreds of short and long range LiDARs from different suppliers in order to automate movement of thousands of vehicles and trucks in a factory environment. The system achieves this with infrastructure-based 3D perception connected to a 5G network. It is the first of its kind to be deployed on a large commercial scale. 2D cameras were used initially but produced an unacceptable number of false positives, degrading system efficiency. Simple, single beam LiDARs were also deployed, but did not provide adequate safety margins and performance. Stereo cameras were severely limited in range. A solution using a combination of high point density short and long range LiDARs, knitted together by Seoul Robotics' software has overcome all these issues. The system is actively being co-developed with other technology providers, with planned implementations at other factory sites. Han Bin Lee: \"We are looking forward to this significant implementation of 3D Vision Technology and expect it to provide massive automation benefits at a high level of safety. The experience gained in a project of this scale will be invaluable for other smart city and smart infrastructure applications\".\n\nFactory automation is exciting - but how about space debris mapping? This sounds a bit, well, spacey, but it is a real problem considering that we have been sending people and equipment into space since the 1960s. There are ~1M estimated pieces of human-created debris in space, in sizes ranging from 1 cm to several meters. These continue to multiply as collisions occur, creating what is known as the Kessler Syndrome which posits that \"the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.\" Currently, only about 5% of the ~1M debris objects are mapped and tracked. The implications of this are immense since it constrains the launch of future vehicles (imagine space tourism and billionaires sipping cocktails in a hail of debris!) for various space exploration efforts.\n\nDigantara is an Indian company focused on space debris mapping (Disclosure: I am an advisor). The company was started in 2018 by a team of engineers/entrepreneurs to create solutions to the space debris mapping problem. They were invited to present their business plan at the prestigious 2019 International Astronautical Federation (IAF) start-up pitch event in Washington D.C. This won them accolades, and more importantly funding. Digantara's data products will prove invaluable for trajectory planning for future space launches, predicting when collisions are likely to occur, updating the debris maps and providing input to companies as they tackle the problem of space debris removal. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), a leading global space agency, provides grants, advise and technical support to the company.\n\nCurrent methods for space debris mapping are ground based, and use a combination of radar and 2d optical telescopes. The mapping is constrained by weather conditions, as well as lighting (cannot map during the day because of solar noise and at night because of lack of illumination). Short range mapping occurs with radar whereas the telescopes can only image at very long range due to the long integration times involved. Orbital mechanics principles and models are used to extract 3D data from from the 2D imagery, although these extrapolations suffer from from fidelity and precision issues. Atmospheric distortion further complicates the problem, with the result that earth based systems are unable to map objects less than 10 cm in diameter reliably and accurately. According to Digantara's Chief Technical Officer, Tanveer Ahmed; \"Digantara solves this problem by using LiDARs mounted on a constellation of CubeSats (small satellites, roughly shoebox size, with a 10 kg load carrying capacity). The use of active 3D imaging to obtain range information in addition to x-y location is a must - since passive imaging of fast moving objects at close ranges would require very large integration times, making the measurement useless. Additionally, LiDAR allows us to control the illumination period and wavelength, enabling significantly higher duty cycles of the mapping system. 3D Imaging in space allows for significantly higher signal-to noise (SNR) performance because of an absence of atmospheric losses and non-linear signal distortions\". The LiDAR is capable of imaging >1 cm size objects moving at speeds of up to 10 km/s at range of 100 km. Data compression occurs in the CubeSat prior to a RF based downlink to earth for further processing. A schematic of the Digantara system is shown in Figure 3.\n\nMoving back to earth, smart phones and smart glasses beckon. Apple (AAPL) pioneered the FaceID application using structured light-based 3D imaging in previous generations of iPhones. This was followed by a world facing VCSEL-SPAD (VCSEL = Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser, SPAD = Single Photon Avalanche Detector) LiDAR in the recent iPad and iPhone generations. Other phone manufacturers have followed suit, since apart from the usual photography and room mapping applications, augmented reality (AR) applications are exploding in diverse areas like gaming and industrial productivity.\n\npmdtechnologies AG was founded in 2002 by academics with 20 years of prior research experience. Headquartered in Seigen, Germany, it specializes in 3D Time-of-Flight (ToF) imagers that generate and extract 3D data using a combination of specialized high resolution CMOS infrared imagers and VCSEL arrays. PMD stands for Photonic Mixer Device - in essence, the VCSEL emits modulated laser beams and the reflected energy is mixed within each detector pixel with a reference electrical signal to extract range information. Electrical circuits within the pixel have the capability for rejecting background illumination noise effects, making for a robust 3D imager that works for scalable ranges (to 10m) under different lighting and weather conditions. Figure 4 illustrates the imager operation.\n\nInfineon and pmdtechnologies collaborated to release the first generation of this imager in 2015 - the REAL3™ image sensor - currently at its sixth generation of productization. Applications include consumer mobile and AR/VR, industrial (automation, surveillance and robotics) and automotive (in-cabin passenger alertness monitoring, as well as road-facing). In 2016, REAL3™ was designed into Google's Project Tango smart-phone (integrated with the ARCore or Augmented Reality software). Other smart-phone design-ins have continued with LG, Huawei and Sharp. According to founder and CEO Bernd Buxbaum, \"the 3D functionality coupled with other motion sensor data in smart phones allows for highly realistic renditions of AR applications, enabling a seamless user experience. Without direct 3D measurements, creating 3D perception is difficult because it relies on assumptions of flat objects, floors and walls, is computationally intensive, and is dependent on good ambient lighting conditions\". ToF sensing enhances the AR experience by providing:\n\nLiDAR capabilities integrated into smart glasses will accelerate AR, industrial productivity, education, remote expert assistance, process automation, gaming and medical applications. The combination of human vision and networked smart glasses with 3D LiDAR imaging capability opens up significant applications in knowledge management and the ongoing transition to the Autonomy of Things (AoT™) revolution.\n\nVuzix (VUZI) is a maker of smart glasses embedded with proprietary waveguide technology that enables low weight, thin and aesthetic glasses comfortable for human use (Disclosure: I am an advisor). Headquartered in Rochester, New York, Vuzix makes smart glasses for customers in applications ranging from remote expert support, logistics and manufacturing to education and tele-medicine. Possible applications are diverse and exciting, and the newly created solutions group headed by Pano Spiliotis (Managing Director of Vuzix Solutions) works with customers to provide information from connected sensor ecosystems via smart glasses. The point is to integrate humans, sensors and stored data in a networked environment, enabling seamless work processes in individual and remote group settings (through integrated teleconferencing applications). Figure 5 illustrates this perfectly.\n\nSmart phones started the revolution by integrating location information with ride sharing services like Uber and Lyft. Smart glasses are the next frontier in driving new networked applications that fuse stored knowledge with 3D locational and visual data. According to Mr. Spiliotis, \"the goal is to connect the real world to the digital world, with 3D vision and maps. Integration of LiDAR with 3D sensing capability in the next generation of smart glasses will enable significant applications \". In addition to the example illustrated in Figure 5, these include:\n\nIt is not surprising that we survived without 3D Vision and LiDAR for such a long time after the invention of the camera more than a century ago. The technology was not scalable beyond a few complex and expensive implementations. But that is rapidly changing as consumer and autonomy application drive high volume implementations of this technology. Associated developments in optics, semiconductors, 3D image processing, artificial intelligence, robotics, computing, cloud and wireless technologies are accelerating applications not possible before. In a few years, it is certain that this new mode of imaging and data visualization will transition from a novelty to a common mode of imaging, similar to camera evolution in the past.",

                "title": "T-Mobile for Business BrandVoice: How 5G Will Transform XR: Emerging Use Cases In 3 Key Industries",
                "body": "For a long time, extended reality remained in the periphery of mainstream enterprise applications. But its crossover to mass adoption is being made possible due to the emergence of an ecosystem that comprises superior hardware, edge computing, graphic rendering capabilities and the arrival of 5G networks.\n\nSupported by this ecosystem, use cases for XR have expanded from primarily gaming to experiences across all industry verticals. In this post, we look at how XR is transforming retail, education and manufacturing.\n\nFrom offering personalization to jazzing up shopping experiences with a multi-sensory approach involving haptics, sight, sound and smell, the retail industry has been pioneering XR tech.\n\nLast year, many luxury brands joined an ecommerce platform to gain access to affluent customers and participate in a new kind of shopping experience. When customers wear an augmented headset or interact with a virtual assistant, they get access to virtual stores or digitized shopping malls, right from wherever they are.\n\nIn another instance in Singapore, 5G technology has been used to set up a 24/7, unmanned pop-up retail store with self-service kiosks for digitally-savvy consumers. Bringing together artificial intelligence, IoT, augmented reality and virtual reality to offer a personalized shopping experience, the pop-up store depends on a reliable 5G connection.\n\nThese kinds of experiences are part of an upcoming sector known as 'retail-tainment', in which the boundaries between shopping and entertainment are blurred. In 2020, China's shoppable livestream market was estimated at $60 billion with over 430 million people viewing livestreams.\n\nThe 5G Impact: In XR, a large amount of content is transferred from multiple sources to the cloud, which then gets downloaded onto your device, which can be a headset, augmented glasses or a mobile phone. As all these touchpoints could be in different locations, you need networks with maximum depth and breadth of coverage to make this happen.\n\n5G works in three bands of wavelength spectrum. High-band frequencies called millimeter waves offer superlative speeds but, as they have limited reach, they are suited for smaller areas. Low-band frequencies of 600MHz offer maximum signal penetration but at lesser speed, while mid-band waves strike an ideal balance between speed and coverage.\n\nFor retail applications that span large geographies, and for those that require higher speed, 5G's low-band and mid-band frequencies can make a difference.\n\nWhat's Happening: XR tech has been playing a key role in the education industry even before the onset of the pandemic.\n\nVR, in particular, has been a powerful tool to break down complex and abstract concepts. It's helping astronomy students understand the correlation between the phases of the moon and the positions of the sun, moon and earth. Another institution has been running VR projects to teach molecular biology and atomic physics. And a 4,000 square-foot VR lab is furthering the understanding of neurological circuits using an interactive, multi-dimensional approach.\n\nStudents at Fisk University are benefiting from a 5G-powered VR cadaver lab. Instructors can remove an organ from a body and pass it on to students, who can look inside the organ to explore better, all virtually. For Fisk University, which had not been able to purchase cadavers due to high costs, and had to rely on other universities, the impact was transformational.\n\nPost-pandemic, XR tools have become an inevitable way to facilitate distance learning. From virtual campus tours to field trips, and from K-12 classrooms to closing gaps in STEM learning in middle and high schools, XR is facilitating the creation of student-centric experiences.\n\nThe 5G Impact: Fast, reliable and low-latency 5G networks can give a big boost to XR in education, where near-real-time data transfer is crucial for an authentic experience.\n\nT-Mobile has America's largest, fastest, and according to network research firm umlaut, most reliable 5G network built to drive XR now and in the future.\n\nFor students, 5G is also about gaining mobility with the flexibility to take classes from their home, car or a cafe. They don't want their XR device to limit their movement, which is the case for the time being. But it might not be that way for long.\n\nWhat's Happening: Already in the early stages of the fourth industrial revolution, the manufacturing sector is going through a sea change with XR as a key enabler. Back in 2015, a leading automaker reduced its production line injury rate by 70% by using VR to immerse employees in a future production environment and assess design feasibility and safety quotient. Another automobile manufacturer uses its state-of-the-art VR center to simulate every part of the vehicle at the design stage and see how it all fits together. These digital twins have helped expedite production cycles and increase engine efficiency.\n\nManufacturing units employ XR in a range of use cases, such as machine maintenance, virtual inspections and training personnel on complex, dangerous machinery.\n\nResearchers have created a system that lets users remotely operate a robot using an augmented headset. What the robot sees, the human sees, opening up the potential for factory employees to work from anywhere. Researchers also speculated that gamers would be suited to take remote manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe 5G Impact: At the heart of Industry 4.0 is the idea of machine-to-machine interconnectedness, in which the entire factory or even factories across locations work as a cohesive unit passing on data from one system to another. This is made possible by IoT sensors, which are getting cheaper over time. To gather this large volume of data from sensors, mash it together and deliver it on your XR devices, you need large bandwidths. This is what 5G networks bring to the table.\n\nSince the 1980s, every turn of a decade has witnessed a new generation of wireless networks. And this has led to innovations such as SMS, email, smartphones, high-definition video streaming and a plethora of mobile applications. 5G, with its focus on high capacity, fast speed and low latencies, offers an unprecedented level of connectivity. The innovation created by this marriage of 5G and XR is exciting, and there's much left to discover.\n\nRegardless of industry, nationwide 5G lays the foundation for businesses to build what's next. From more efficient field operations to smarter cities, see what the 5G future could look like -- and why choosing the right network provider matters.\n\nMost Reliable: According to independent third party umlaut from crowdsourced user experience data (January to July 2021). Fastest: Based on average, overall combined 5G speeds according to Opensignal Awards (USA: 5G User Experience Report July 2021). See 5G device, coverage, & access details at T-Mobile.com.",

                "title": "New York CTO publishes AI strategy guide | StateScoop",
                "body": "A new strategy guide published this week by New York City Chief Technology Officer John Paul Farmer highlights the city's current artificial-intelligence research while proposing a future in which AI touches virtually every municipal process.\n\nThe 116-page strategy, including a 31-page \"AI Primer\" that outlines the basics of artificial intelligence and machine learning, is \"relevant to every agency,\" Farmer told StateScoop.\n\nFarmer's office interviewed representatives from more than 50 organizations, including city agencies, universities, technology companies and local nonprofits to gather information for the \"foundational\" strategy. He said those interviews included which applications the city could use, and how the city might shift its procurement approach when obtaining new, AI-powered technologies.\n\nWhile it doesn't make sense for every agency to purchase an AI-powered solution right away, the prevalence of AI in data analysis will ensure that every agency is impacted by the city's investment in the technology, said Neal Parikh, the director of artificial intelligence in Farmer's office.\n\n\"The different ways in which different parts of the city government interact with the topic of AI. In some cases it's sort of direct AI applications, in other cases its policy, in other cases its education and in other cases its public engagement,\" Parikh said.\n\nThe guide also outlines the city's current AI use cases and related policies. While some agencies, like the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene, use AI and machine-learning tools directly, others like the Mayor's Office of Contract Services are only impacted indirectly (such as when it reviews contracts).\n\nTo expand the AI use citywide, though, Farmer and Parikh said New York needs to modernize its data infrastructure -- something that would yield \"a wide range of benefits above and beyond their potential use in actual AI applications,\" the guide reads.\n\n\"The next step is modernizing the city's data infrastructure, because you can't slap AI on something if the data itself isn't ready to work with the tools and if the data isn't representative,\" Farmer said. \"That's a recipe to not get the results you want to see.\"\n\nMore specifically, the report recommends that the city adopt a \"central framework\" that individual agencies could use to build out their data strategies, as well as establish working groups with city leaders to ensure those strategies are consistent with one another. The city also can't hire data engineers or AI experts without a robust data ecosystem in place first, the report concluded.\n\nFarmer said any AI-focused collaborations that the city would like to establish with universities, businesses or nonprofits face similar roadblocks.\n\n\"In terms of partnerships, we want to grow productive external partnerships, because ultimately, no matter how much we upscale or bring in AI-know-how into government, there's going to be so much more outside that's with academia, with research labs, with businesses of all sizes,\" he said. \"So it's about forming the appropriate partnerships so we really are bringing benefits to people's daily lives.\"\n\nTo identify the most promising use cases for AI in city government, the report recommends that leaders select a mix of agencies to review the best ways the technology can be applied. A \"central interdisciplinary team\" of experts could then recommend and approve AI-focused use cases, including \"making human decisions more transparent and rigorous, directly addressing social problems or delivering social services,\" the guide states.\n\nParikh and Farmer said that although the strategy is intended for city-government executives, they plan to conduct public engagement to ensure that residents are aware of how AI is used in their communities.\n\n\"The fact that public engagement in AI is at a very early stage presents an excellent opportunity for New York City to creatively explore and help define this space, but these initiatives should be approached in an experimental spirit,\" the strategy reads.",

The International White Cane Day is observed worldwide every year on 15 October to recognise the achievements of visually impaired people and their movement from dependency to active participation in society.\n\nSheikh Mansoor bin Mohammed said: \"The UAE's leadership is committed to creating an empowering environment for people of determination to participate equally in all sectors and spheres of life. The UAE believes in the power of inclusiveness, and in implementing it in its full spirit to provide people of determination with opportunities to realise their talent and potential and contribute to shaping the future of the nation. We will continue to spare no effort in enabling people of determination to not only function in society with ease and independence but also live their lives to the fullest.\"\n\nHis Highness was accompanied by Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, Minister of Tolerance and Coexistence; Hessa bint Essa Buhumaid, Minister of Community Development; Reem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy, Minister of State for International Cooperation, and Director General of Expo 2020 Dubai; and Abdullah Abdul-Ali Al Humaidan, Secretary-General of the Zayed Higher Organization for People of Determination.\n\nThe White Cane March featured the military band of Dubai Police. Etisalat supported the event as a Main Partner. A number of senior officials, visually impaired people and Expo visitors also participated in the event.\n\nHessa bint Essa Buhumaid emphasised that the White Cane March reflects the UAE's social values and its commitment to the welfare of various segments of the community. The event offered participants an opportunity to express their support for and solidarity with the visually impaired. she stressed on the need to inculcate a community culture that promotes sensitivity to the needs of people of determination and facilitates their independence, backed by the services, policies and initiatives of the UAE government and various entities.\n\nShe said: \"Expo 2020 Dubai has paid special attention to organising a people of determination-friendly event by offering them privileges, services and facilities designed to make their experience exceptional. Expo 2020 Dubai seeks to be the best ever World Expo in history in terms of accessibility for people of determination. The symbolic march organised today reaffirms the UAE leadership's commitment to ensuring the happiness and wellbeing of all people of determination.\"\n\nBuhumaid noted that the UAE seeks to promote active social participation of people of determination and provide them equal opportunities within an inclusive environment. The word 'people of determination' was coined to empower them to play an active role in the community and overcome all challenges.\n\nThe Minister of Community Development added that this national policy has been implemented in an integrated manner to ensure that buildings across the country are accessible to people of determination. The UAE's Universal Design Code supports this policy by creating a set of unified guidelines for designing accessible buildings, facilities and services, she added.\n\nReem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy, Minister of State for International Cooperation, and Director General of Expo 2020 Dubai said: \"The extensive and high-level participation in the White Cane March shows the UAE's commitment to integrating all members of the community without any exception and ensuring their wellbeing and happiness. This is clearly reflected in our efforts to promote human development and dignity.\n\nShe stressed that Expo 2020 Dubai seeks to promote an international dialogue to create new opportunities and build a future centred on human dignity, while also fostering an environment that stimulates creativity, innovation and empowered leadership.\n\n\"These themes are strongly reflected in the organisation of Expo 2020 Dubai. We have sought to address the needs of different segments of society and provided various facilities and services to ensure ease of access for all and a safe, seamless and exceptional visitor experience.\"\n\nAl Hashemy added that efforts to address the needs of people of determination also extend to the events and programmes at Expo 2020. People of determination have also been provided all opportunities to be part of the workforce of the event.\n\nAbdul Rahman Ahmed Al Bastaki, Director of the Emirates Association of Visually Impaired, said: \"Celebrating the International White Cane Day demonstrates the sincere desire of social entities and individuals to raise public awareness about the importance of using the white cane; the white cane is not a symbol of visual impairment but one of the most important tools for their freedom and independence. Its users have confidence in themselves without the need to seek others' help. Each year, the Association is keen to organise the White Cane March as well as educate the community on the importance of the white cane and its symbolic significance.\n\nHe added that the march held at Expo is part of a new effort to raise awareness about the needs of people of determination among visitors of all nationalities within the framework of the Association's community awareness building programmes. At the end of the march, Etisalat gave away gifts to people of determination in recognition of their participation, emphasising the need for interaction, support and empowerment of people of determination in the UAE.\n\nDr. Ahmed bin Ali, Senior Vice President Corporate Communications at ETISALAT said: \"Etisalat is honoured to be a main partner for this event. We seek to harness our vast technical capabilities to support and serve people of determination. Our participation in the International White Cane Day on 15 October each year reflects our keenness to further strengthen our corporate social responsibility towards all the members of the community and find innovative solutions to enable people of determination to use telecommunications services and technical facilities easily and smoothly based on our strategy to empower communities and usher in a new digital future.\"\n\nBin Ali added: \"Etisalat lauds the efforts of the Ministry of Community Development and its pivotal role in supporting people of determination in various forums and events through many distinct initiatives. Etisalat places high priority on people of determination, as part of which we are keen to provide them a range of exceptional innovative services and develop new solutions to empower them by leveraging on advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, internet of Things (IOT), augmented reality, virtual reality and 5G.\n\nExpo 2020 Dubai offers free tickets to people of determination, while one of their companions can avail a 50% discount. They can also obtain a range of services by presenting approved government cards such as: people of determination card and Sanad card in the UAE, as well as cards for Disability Living Allowance (DLA), Personal Independence Payments (PIP), EU card for people of determination, the USA's ADA card for people of determination, and the French card for people of determination, among others.\n\nExpo 2020 offers the 'PoDium' app, an interactive technology platform specifically designed to help people of determination tour the site and get information on accessible features and facilities in each pavilion. The site offers accessible facilities to a range of people of determination include those with visual and hearing impairment, intellectual impairment, dementia, photo-sensitive epilepsy and reduced mobility.",

                "body": "For all its ability to speed government services and boost jobs in the technology industry, artificial intelligence carries the potential for abuses, including \"explicit, outright discrimination,\" if not properly regulated, a new city report warns.\n\nThe 115-page \"New York City AI Strategy\" document, published Oct. 13 by John Paul Farmer, Mayor Bill de Blasio's chief technology officer, is the most comprehensive municipal effort yet to understand how algorithms and automation are likely to influence how New Yorkers live.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly assuming integral roles in everyday life,\" Farmer said in the report's introduction. \"But the general public and some key decision-makers do not yet understand them well.\"\n\nThe possibility of AI abuses is an issue that lawmakers are grappling with at many levels. Advisers to President Joe Biden last week suggested he spearhead a technology \"bill of rights\" aimed at protecting Americans from AI tools that invade privacy or discriminate.\n\nOne major area of concern is that decision-making programs powered by AI have human biases baked in, affecting how people are hired, admitted to schools and even criminally sentenced. A bill under review in the City Council, for instance, would require online hiring tools that rely on AI for decision-making be audited for biases.\n\nThe city report, which describes itself as a baseline to help guide lawmakers' decisions, says:\n\nNew York City has become a hub for the industry, capturing 13% of all U.S. jobs in AI and $7 billion in private investment. The city is also a base for AI research by Facebook, Google and Microsoft, as well as by health centers including Mount Sinai.\n\nThe growth of the technology necessitates city regulators have a grasp of how it works, such as how the city Taxi and Limousine Commission must understand how Lyft and Uber use AI to predict demand, price rides and dispatch drivers.\n\nGovernment has used the technology to uncover potential locations with lead contamination in water and to identify students at risk of not graduating. More controversial uses include algorithms in the court that assess whether a person should be released before trial and facial-recognition technology employed in NYPD investigations.\n\nThe city developed an AI program to automatically analyze the 15,000 utility bills the Division of Energy Management processes and pays each month for facilities. The system spotted small anomalies and errors that added up to $4.5 million in refunds in the past two years.\n\nThe report stops short of recommending any direct policies. It suggests the city consider how to better harness AI to share data among departments and with the public, through the New York City Open Data website. It also suggests officials open up more career-training programs in the AI and machine-learning fields, as well as engage the public to hear how use of the technology has affected them.\n\nYou can view the full report here.",

                "title": "Book Review: 'Our Wild Calling'",
                "body": "Anita L. Sherman is an award-winning journalist who has more than 20 years of experience as a writer and editor for local papers and regional publications in Virginia. She now works as a freelance writer and is working on her first novel. She is the mother of three grown children and grandmother to four, and she resides in Warrenton, Va. Anita can be reached at anitajustwrite@gmail.com\n\nAcclaimed nature journalist and author Richard Louv has written several books most notably \"Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder,\" \"The Nature Principle,\" and \"Vitamin N.\"\n\nHis writings have been instrumental in birthing an international movement to connect children, families, and communities more closely with nature. He is co-founder and chair emeritus of the non-profit Children and Nature Network. He lectures throughout the world and in 2008 was awarded the Audubon Medal.\n\nIn \"Our Wild Calling,\" he examines human-animal coexistence and what that future might look like.\n\nFollowing years of research, involving conversations from indigenous healers and wildlife experts to scientists and therapists, Louv presents his case of what he calls the \"habitat of the heart.\" He envisions a sustainable and shared habitat for all creatures -- not out of fear but based on love.\n\nLouv examines our connections to animals, whether in our homes, our communities, or in the wild.\n\nLiving in a digital age where connecting with someone is a click away doesn't always guarantee a close relationship. Louv talks about \"species loneliness\" and provides data that despite the advances in technology, large segments of our human population (notably seniors and many young people) remain isolated and disconnected from each other.\n\n\"Social media does have certain charms and, in some cases, brings us together. But for many people, electronic connection is metastasizing into electronic over connection, overwhelming our capacity for patience, interrupting the focus required to build real-time relationships,\" he writes.\n\nIn addition to studies on how animals communicate with themselves and other species, Louv shares many stories of real-life encounters, like oceanographer Paul Dayton's life-changing literal connection to an octopus -- it entangled itself on his head and back as he was diving and accompanied him to the surface. The experience left him shaken but mesmerized -- and with a great story to share with grandchildren.\n\nWhite-tailed deer routinely show up on many suburban neighborhood lawns throughout the northeast. Bears have no qualms about taking out backyard bird feeders or confronting hikers on forest trails. And coyotes in the big city? Thousands roam the streets of Chicago.\n\nCreating and living in an environment where humans and animals can live in concert with greater understanding and mutual respect is Louv's theme throughout as he dissects current thinking when it comes to urban planning, how our educational systems can do better to connect children to nature, and the rise of artificial intelligence. Is it possible to form an emotional relationship with a robotic dog?\n\nLouv would argue for a real-life connection:\n\n\"The right animal can give a child a deeper capacity for wonder and empathy, as well as a set of symbols to help make sense of the world. We are more than walking genetic code; we are biological poems, and so are the creatures around us. We do not create the code or language, but we do make meaning out of it. We write the first lines of that poem as children. Our companion animals humanize us. They can offer unconditional love and show us how to give it. They give us the gift of shared imperfections, the seed of sympathy and humor. They join our pack. Or we join theirs. They and we co-become. We are not alone.\"\n\nLouv credits the openness of many psychologists, psychotherapists, and occupational therapists to see the benefits of animals used in therapy, and in some cases, to detect illnesses. Patients suffering from depression or dementia can be helped through a relationship with a domestic animal.\n\nLouv looks to a frontier where wild animals could influence mental health and therapy. Ecotherapists are leading in that direction by integrating the natural environment into their treatment plans.\n\nCreating a home for all creatures has its challenges. Louv looks at pockets in this country and efforts in other countries to renew or restore threatened environments. His position is that partnering with animals is highly preferable to exploiting them. His optimism sees a \"nature culture\" of human and animal communities co-existing rather than as separate entities.\n\nOne example that Louv points out is in upstate New York -- Adirondack Park:\n\n\"In the nineteenth century, the mountains there were stripped of life by loggers. In the early twentieth century, farmers, scientists, conservationists, and the state's voters established five hundred thousand acres to be \"forever wild.\" Then, through land trusts, conservation easements, and other methods, the park grew to three million acres - 20 percent of the state.\n\nToday Adirondack Park is thriving, both for people and for wildlife. It serves as an economic and ecological model for similar preserves that could be created around the world.\"\n\n\"Our Wild Calling\" is definitely worth the read and reminds us of our beautiful world and that reconnecting with animals can have remarkable results and be a potent remedy for loneliness.\n\nWhile we may not always acknowledge our togetherness on this planet, we are on a shared journey, compatible at times and at other times challenging. Louv lays an engaging and compelling case for us to remember our connections.\n\nAs Louv suggests, \"Whether animals are capable of love as we know it (though most of us believe they are), animals do bring us into contact with other people. They act as anti-rumination agents. They pull us out of ourselves and bring us into ourselves. They lead us home.\"\n\n\"This essential connection or communion with other creatures -- this habitat of the heart -- is fragile. It needs nourishment to survive, as do they and we.\"",

                "title": "Flight of the Concord Drones",
                "body": "The City Council of Concord, California, is tone deaf to community concerns regarding a proposed police Unmanned Aerial Surveillance (UAS) system - commonly referred to as drones. In a city where the police department is responsible for nearly 60% of the city budget, this should come as no surprise. The UAS program, however, will strangely be funded by Marathon Petroleum, which has no offices or facilities in Concord. EFF, ACLU, and 15 other Contra Costa community organizations opposed this action. We also demanded police oversight and ample safeguards to protect civil liberties and civil rights if the program were to be adopted.\n\nPrivacy and police accountability are a massive issue with UAS systems, and are both high priority issues for California voters, as evidenced by the passage of California Consumer Privacy Act and police accountability legislation.\n\nDrones are unmanned aerial vehicles that can be equipped with high definition, live-feed video cameras, thermal infrared video cameras, heat sensors, and radar -- all of which allow for sophisticated and persistent surveillance. Drones can record video or still images in daylight or at night (with infrared lenses). They can also be equipped with software tools like license plate readers, face recognition, and GPS trackers that extend the dangers they pose to privacy. There have even been proposals for law enforcement to attach lethal and non-lethal weapons to drones. Additionally, newly developed drone automation allows for automatic tracking of vehicles and individuals.\n\nEFF and our allies sent a letter urging the Concord City Council to not adopt a UAS system for Concord Police Department. If, however, the city council decided to approve the UAS system, we made specific recommendations to provide ample safeguards to protect civil liberties and civil rights:\n\nFirst, drones should be deployed only with a warrant, or in an emergency that threatens death or serious bodily injury to a person. All deployments should be thoroughly documented, and that documentation must be made publicly available.\n\nSecond, facial recognition technology, artificial intelligence, automated tracking, heat sensors, license plate readers, cell-phone interception, and lethal and non-lethal weapons should be prohibited as incorporated technologies to UAS drones.\n\nThird, there must be clear rules regarding access to UAS footage. Officers suspected of misconduct must not be allowed to view footage until they have made an initial statement regarding the episode. People depicted in footage must have access to the footage. Also, footage depicting police use of force must be available to the public. Similar to the flaws in body worn cameras, police can exercise too much control over the video before the public sees it without police oversight.\n\nMore generally, Concord should adopt a Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) ordinance. A CCOPS law acts to promote transparency, the public's welfare, civil rights, and civil liberties in all decisions regarding the funding, acquisition, and deployment of surveillance equipment by local police. Such a law would appropriately require city departments to provide the public with information about surveillance proposals, including a draft usage policy, weeks rather than days before the proposals are debated before the City Council.\n\nNot only did the Concord City Council approve the police drones, it also failed to adopt these meaningful safeguards. Concord, like many other municipalities, decided instead to use a boilerplate, unprotective Lexipol policy. Will Concord become the next Chula Vista, which deploys a drone for nearly every 911 call? Only time will tell. Concord's drone policy is permissive enough that it could be.",

                "body": "Artificial Intelligence and machine learning is paving their way in almost all industries. Its next target is the high-tech industry. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence in the engineering and mechanical world has raised many questions. What is the scope of Artificial Intelligence in the high-tech industry? Is it a good idea to invest in AI? Will AI replace the engineers? Is it easy for Artificial intelligence to overtake all the high-tech fields?\n\nThere is no doubt that Artificial intelligence is developing rapidly. It is capable of versatile applications and has marked remarkable changes in many industries. We have the example of Google, Amazon, and Facebook algorithms in front of us. But with the current developments in AI, it cannot overtake the high-tech mechanical and engineering industry anytime soon. It may modify the traditional tools of the industry, but it is useless without the human workforce.\n\nIn this article, we have evaluated the scope of Artificial Intelligence in the high-tech industry. We have also discussed the obstacles to adopting AI in the industry.\n\nAI is now part of almost every industry, including high-tech. It has made significant progress in recent years and seems to have a good scope in the tech field.\n\nThe most significant development of Artificial Intelligence is in the research field. Today, AI tools and software are much more efficient in holding the data and evaluating it. They help the researchers in making the most of the existing research. Researchers can now focus more on finding new solutions than investing time in extracting information from previous work with the help of AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence can process and evaluate data much more quickly and efficiently than the human brain. It can hold much more data than traditional computing devices and process it in just a few seconds. Now whether you want to correlate the existing database with centuries-old data. Or need to drive results based on an extensive database, AI software and tools are there to assist you. They can serve as the efficient assistants of data analysts and may take over their roles one day.\n\nAI tools and software work with much larger databases and are expected to make accurate judgments in most cases. For instance, a human brain may get confused in identifying a metal or chemical. But AI tools can detect it accurately and efficiently.\n\nSimilarly, fingerprint detection and face feature detection can be done swiftly and with lesser doubts using AI tools. Due to the accuracy of AI tools, it is assumed that Artificial Intelligence will replace many engineers and specialists in the future.\n\nThough the scope of AI seems to be quite promising in the high-tech industry, there are some obstacles to adopting AI.\n\nAll AI-based projects require a lot of time and investment. Industries and organizations need special hardware and software tools for executing the AI model. Furthermore, training the model is itself a very time-consuming and costly procedure.\n\nSince AI experiments' success rate is not promising, many investors are reluctant to invest their resources in such projects. Thus, the limitation of investment in high-risk AI projects is one of the major obstacles in adopting it in the high-tech industry.\n\nBuilding AI-based hardware and training AI models is a very time taking and tedious process. It yields results at a slower pace.\n\nKeeping in mind the faster pace of the high-tech industry, most AI machines and models become outdated even before their actual execution. This time-lapse between the idea and its execution is a hindrance in the way of developing AI.\n\nAI tools and software are dependent on the data feed to them. They can only process and evaluate the data that is there in the system. Anything beyond the scope of existing information is beyond the capacity of AI tools as well. Moreover, it cannot detect errors in the data fed to it.\n\nTherefore, any human error in feeding data can result in the failure of the whole AI model. Therefore, this data dependence is another major obstacle in its adoption in the high-tech industry.\n\nHigh tech industry demands quick and efficient decision-making. Unfortunately, though AI tools can make fast and efficient judgments in many situations, they lack creativity.\n\nNo AI tools, to date, can take abstract decisions based on the scenarios like a human mind can do. No doubt AI tools are versatile, yet they are far behind the creative capacity of the human brain.\n\nArtificial Intelligence seems to have a good scope in the high-tech industry, especially in the telecommunication and computing fields. But it still has a long way to go before being adopted in the biotechnical and engineering fields.\n\nAI is a high-risk investment. And reluctance in adopting AI is a significant barrier in the way of its development and progress.",

                "title": "MIL-OSI Banking: Protect The Poor When Fighting Money Laundering in the Pacific  —...",
                "body": "The risk of \"de-risking\" - the process of international banks disassociating from financial partners, such as small remittance providers and local banks - is that it could push people out of the financial system completely.\n\nIn the Pacific, where many countries are just starting to build financial infrastructure, local banks depend on formal relationships with international banks to send and receive international payments.\n\nThese correspondent banking relationships -- by facilitating trade, foreign investment, and remittances -- are a lifeline for businesses and humanitarian organizations, fostering financial inclusion for millions by making accounts available to send and receive remittances.\n\nThe relationships -- in which one financial institution (the correspondent) provides another a deposit account or other services (the respondent) -- allow a flow of finance vital to countries' economic prosperity.\n\nYet, today, Pacific island banks and remittance providers struggle to retain these crucial banking relationships amid \"de-risking\": international banks terminating or restricting commercial relationships with partners they deem risky. These include remittance companies and smaller local banks in some regions.\n\nOver the past decade, international correspondent bank relationships have declined about one-fifth worldwide and continue to fall. The decline in correspondent banking relationships in the Pacific is broadly in line with global averages over this period. However, this masks the disproportionate effect on small Pacific island countries.\n\nWhile correspondent banks connect Pacific island countries to the global financial system, they also expose Pacific island countries to risks such as money laundering, which demand additional regulatory responses.\n\nThese risks emerge even though the correspondent banks undertake their due diligence when performing transactions for respondent banks and track those risk management and compliance efforts. Respondent banks, in turn, are responsible for normal transaction oversight, including filing suspicious activity reports.\n\nThe capacity to accomplish such reports, nonetheless, is often lacking.\n\nThe factors driving de-risking include a combination of cost/benefit considerations as well as concerns regarding anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)\n\nStricter regulatory and enforcement since the global financial crisis has tightened anti-money laundering regulations, increased tax transparency, and applied more effective economic and trade sanctions to detect and deter criminal activity and reduce the chance and costs of future systemic financial crises.\n\nThese tighter rules require correspondent banks to ensure they comply with international guidelines or legal and regulatory frameworks, including know-your-customer (KYC) rules. Banks also now need to hold larger capital buffers to draw on during economic downturns.\n\nThese stricter regulations have led correspondent banks and financial institutions to re-evaluate their risk appetite when transacting with jurisdictions that may lack robust implementation and enforcement, such as the Pacific islands.\n\nA steady increase in compliance costs and rising fines and penalties imposed for non-compliance has driven this 'de-risking'. Western Union, for example, spends over $200 million a year on risk and compliance, with 20% of its employee base dedicated solely to this function.\n\nMany correspondent banks have found that profits from remittance transactions do not compensate for their high compliance costs and the risks of non-compliance. By de-risking and ceasing to transact with respondent banks, these financial institutions have reduced their exposure to fines and penalties, decreased compliance costs, and minimized reputational risk.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing in the Pacific is low.\n\nIronically, the stricter regulatory and enforcement landscape developed to ensure financial stability increasingly excludes valid customers from formal finance and forces them to look at informal systems.\n\nRather than reducing risk in the global financial sector, the continuing decline in correspondent bank relationships could harm regional and international financial integration, financial inclusion, financial transparency, and thus economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\nThis is doubly ironic in the Pacific Islands. Multiple studies have shown that the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing in the Pacific is low.\n\nIf the correspondent banking network gets even smaller, it would reduce competition and likely erase years of progress in reducing remittance costs and fees. In addition, scarce options and higher fees could force remitters to use riskier, less regulated such as informal networks or cryptocurrency.\n\nThis would increase financial system risk, particularly given that the latter often lack proper cybersecurity, basic risk management, legal certainty, or consumer protection. This risks further isolating vulnerable communities, particularly women, from the formal financial sector, with wide-ranging humanitarian, economic, and security implications.\n\nAddressing de-risking will require collaborative work among development partners, governments, technology providers, and service providers to help Pacific Island countries adopt practices to rebuild and maintain correspondent banking relationships. Here are four ways to get started:\n\nA scalable, risk-based application of anti-money laundering regulation is required. In meeting requirements, financial institutions can ensure stringent regulation is not imposed on remittance providers that generate many but lower-value and lower risk transactions and typically do not threaten financial stability.\n\nA risk-based approach would apply lower compliance requirements for smaller, lower-risk institutions by using risk assessment that increases compliance requirements with the likelihood of criminal activity. This would use resources more effectively; minimize compliance costs and burdens on customers; and boost flexibility to respond to emerging risks.\n\nCreate or modernize identity verification systems and update legislative and regulatory environments for affordable and automated financial authentication and authorization. Identification is key to safe financial transactions, and accurate ID verification is required for account opening and financial inclusion.\n\nBiometrics, blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data offer potential solutions to create digital legal identities, delivering trust, security, and privacy for citizens and saving millions for public and private sectors.\n\nIncrease awareness of anti-money laundering requirements and strengthen remittance operators in low-capacity jurisdictions. Some banks in Pacific Island countries have financial and digital literacy programs that could be the basis for training on sending and receiving remittances. Such training can also be linked to the seasonal employer labor mobility programs in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nHelp countries develop know-your-customer technology and processes that benefit compliant organizations and boost consumer confidence in the privacy of personal information. Several jurisdictions have developed, or are developing, robust know-your-customer and customer due diligence platforms to standardize information sharing between banks and between banks and regulators. This reduces due diligence costs and enables better enforcement.\n\nIndia, for instance, has developed a digital identity platform that enables paper-free know-your-customer procedures, reducing the costs of adding new customers and easing compliance with regulations. And the Central Bank of Samoa, with ADB support, is developing a web-based platform to verify the identity of remittance senders and receivers. It checks against sanctions, politically exposed persons lists, and other due diligence measures.\n\nThe decline of correspondent banking results from multiple causes, and no single action will reverse this trend. We need a comprehensive and coherent approach to de-risking that consolidates international efforts through targeted action and a consistent voice.",

                "title": "Hot Stocks Outlook for October 15, 2021",
                "body": "The Hot Stocks Outlook uses VantagePoint's market forecasts that are up to 87.4% accurate, demonstrating how traders can improve their timing and direction. In this week's video, VantagePoint Software reviews forecasts for General Dynamics ($GD), Nasdaq Index ($NQ) , Netflix ($NFLX), American Tower ($AMT), Quest Diagnostics ($DGX), and PBF Energy ($PBF)\n\nHello again, traders and welcome back to the Hot Stocks Outlook for October 15th, 2021. I hope y'all are having an excellent week out there in the financial markets. And as always, a lot to cover here in today's outlook. So really a lot of interesting things going on that I really want to cover here, but we're going to start out here with General Dynamics. It's a really good example of how all of these predictive tools work really regardless of the markets that you're trading. And so what we're going to do is revisit the NASDAQ, which we looked at over the past few weeks.\n\nNetflix and PBF Energy here, we actually looked at last week. So let's go update those forecasts, but also a couple of different markets that I want to bring in and really explain a lot of what's going on and how traders can use a lot of these tools to get ahead of these moves.\n\nGeneral Dynamics ($GD)\n\nSo starting out here with General Dynamics, what we have is daily price action. And it's very important to understand that all of these forecasts and predictive indicators that are generated work off of end of day data.\n\nAnd so you have all of this information before the next trading day actually at 6:00 PM Eastern, the trading day before the markets opened the next morning. And so right up against that daily price action, you'll see on this chart, we have a black line and also a blue line. Now the black line that you're seeing there, that is a simple moving average and it's very common technical indicator. We refer to it as the actual simple moving average, but all that it does and all that really most technical indicators do is look back at previous price action and sort of rework that data. So a 10-day simple moving average, which is what this black line is. It's going to look back over the previous 10 closes, it adds in together and then divide by 10.\n\nAnd so it does a good job of smoothing out the existing price action and letting you know where a market has been, but obviously a trader needs to know where is the market likely to move next. And so what we're able to do is compare that black moving average or that simple moving average of where the market currently is, and we want to compare that to this blue predicted moving average. And for that number, that value to get calculated and plotted against the chart each and every trading day, this is where Vantagepoint's technology is coming into play.\n\nAnd so rather than just looking at past price closes of General Dynamics and just plotting along and sort of getting dragged around by the most recent close prices, what Vantagepoint is able to do is look at market relationships that are known to drive and influence the future price of General Dynamics. Now, in most stocks, this'll be things like the mini S&P, the NASDAQ, these broad indices share some very important market relationships, and we can extract some valuable insights into what's likely to occur.\n\nBut there's also very subtle relationships happening in the ETFs and that makes sense. Those are broad groups of markets, but also very subtle relationships with individual stocks that an individual trader simply isn't going to be able to identify. You have to understand it's not only are there inverse or positively correlated markets, but there's also leads and lags in relationships within markets that can, again, extract some very significant insight into where things are likely to head in the short-term. But when you continue this on, you think about, \"Okay, well, what global currencies, interest rates?\"\n\nIf you're trying to trade energy stocks like we've highlighted over the past few weeks, well, those are highly driven by crude oil, commodities, natural gas prices. And so what this is able to do is understand those unique market relationships to the target market that you're trading at that time, and actually generate future price predictions of where price is expected to go. And it's that predictive data of price that's actually used and built-in to calculate these indicators. So rather than having a tool that just looks back at the past, you have a forward-looking predictive tool.\n\nNow in the case of the predicted moving average, it's very simple. As long as that blue line moves above the black line, you expect average prices or this really being this expectation of average prices to keep moving higher. But if we continue on with that technology and say, \"Okay, well, we can use it to really improve the overall trend direction with our predicted moving averages. Well, how might we use it for very short-term price action?\" And this is where tools like the Vantagepoint Predicted Neural Index come into play.\n\nSo this changes every single trading day. Well, it doesn't change. It can remain green or remain red, but every single day you get a new calculation. And what those neural networks are doing are forecasting short-term strength, but tuned to just look ahead 48 hours into the future. And this is sort of a big key to all this is these indicators in artificial intelligence, you need to instruct it. What are you trying to get at? What is the end goal? Well for the neural index, that's a 48-hour predictive outlook. And it gets that right essentially on average of all markets about 80-plus percent of the time. About four to five times, it's going to get that right, but you're also provided intraday predicted high and predicted low levels.\n\nSo again, you can think of, Well, what's the problem here?\" Well, we're trying to figure out intraday, what's the low that this market's likely to hit or what's the high. And that's where all of this technology is working on all these different problems as a trader of needing to figure out, \"Well, where should I be buying? What markets are reversing trend?\" But more importantly, how to manage positions as time goes forward. And this is really what I want to get at because Vantagepoint is such a good, predictive and adaptive technology. And you see that every day, you have these predicted levels before the trading day occurs.\n\nSo you can see that we have a predicted range here, yesterday we hit that and you close inside the range here. The previous days you were hitting these predicted highs and moving lower, but you see how effective this is as a forecasting tool to let you know that, \"Okay, long-term trend is up. I may want to be buying down at these predicted lows and holding for the longer term. If I'm shorter-term, I'm taking profit up at these predicted highs. Maybe managing the position.\" Buying at these predicted lows, taking profit and using those profits to hold out for the longer-term as long as that blue line remains above the black line.\n\nNow there's a lot of different ways that a trader may want to manage this, but the real key is having this tool that's really going to allow you to say, \"Okay, well, I see how things are shifting.\" Here General Dynamics just over the past 12 days, the market's only moved up about 3% or so, but you've been buying all way at the very bottom of these ranges and potentially taking these big chunks of market out as this market starts to move higher. Now, this is what I want to get across though is that we can recognize how things are shifting broadly throughout the marketplace and therefore how we might want to set up our portfolio.\n\nNasdaq Index ($NQ)\n\nSo here's the NASDAQ. And now we talked about this crossover moving to the downside and Facebook and things starting to look fairly weak, but we can see that we actually have a crossover to the bullish side here recently, but there's a lot of volatility here. So you see the neural index getting bearish. We have these lower lows coming through, but what are we seeing currently at least in this most recent price action is strength coming through the NASDAQ and certain stocks recovering. And so this has been extremely helpful when you're trying to set up that portfolio. A.\n\nAnd what its really highlighted is that there's really been some recent opportunities, in my opinion, in individual names to go ahead and get long. You can see that if you're trading the index here, you still have that good guidance to help you, but clearly things have shifted here and not just today. This is several days ago. We've started to see a lot more fresh crossovers come through the use of the IntelliScan feature. So we actually have these tools that can really highlight on the night of these fresh crossovers and shifts and get these important things right on your radar right when they happen so you can recognize how things are shifting and changing in the market.\n\nNow, last week, we talked about how, yes, things still looked weak on the index level going into that.\n\nNetflix ($NFLX),\n\nThat was made an entire week ago, but there were some areas where certainly the software is indicating that you can go ahead and get long, but I just want to highlight here the accuracy of the forecast over the past week here in Netflix. And so you can see here that after this trading day, the neural index goes bearish. And again, what that's highlighting is just short-term weakness over the next 48 hours.\n\nBut as long as that blue line remains above the black line, the overall trend is up. And every single trading day, you've got a new predicted high and a predicted low range. So from last week, you get the market closes here and look at this guidance every single day saying expect this to be the high, this to be the low, this to be the high, this to be the low, this the high, this the low, this the high. But you're only being long in this market. So all you're doing is potentially taking profit and proving your position by buying down at these levels. And we've seen the NASDAQ in some of these broader markets improve and stocks do fairly well.\n\nI know we're at least hitting, again, the predicted high. So that trade management even if you run the sideways, you're still able to pull some money out of the market, recognize as things are shifting like the NASDAQ or some of these other markets, this comes to the downside, well, you'll know what to do. And so when you see some of this information going on in the indexes, it can inform some of your other trading.\n\nAmerican Tower ($AMT)\n\nSo in American Rower and Quest Diagnostics, here are some clear markets that are in downtrends.\n\nBut the things that I just like to highlight is you see that the software here is telling you look for some short-term strength. We haven't gotten that crossover yet, but you do see a lot of these warning signs coming through that says, \"Okay, well, there's been some areas where we can short and take profits on those shorts.\" And certainly that's been the right thing to do, but we get this information from other markets that's letting us know that, \"Hey, things are shifting.\" And if they're shifting at the index level, well, we certainly might want to be a little bit more cautious and expect some higher prices at the very least, even if we want to remain short until that crossover comes to the bullish side there.\n\nBut again, you see just the accuracy of the short-term forecasts and broadly here. Again, to let you know that, look, it's not all weak out there. There's certainly some strength coming in here and opening up some tremendous opportunities to go ahead and get long. And that's where things like the IntelliScan can really guide you and recognize these shifts that are coming to the upside and where he might want to stake out those positions, put in limit orders and buy on these predicted lows and these levels coming through.\n\nQuest Diagnostics ($DGX)\n\nQuest Diagnostics, very similar sort of situation. And again, just highlighting that there's these ways that you can use this sort of information from the index is even understand that at the very least expect some higher prices here. There's strength coming in, but clearly a really nice place to manage some weakness over this past couple of weeks. And then you see how many markets are going to match the NASDAQ and the S&P and things going lower. What's really easy to figure out which markets are really following that correlation pretty closely because they all turn down at about the same period and at midpoint in September there. So you see about a 10% decline in shares of Quest here.\n\nPBF Energy ($PBF)\n\nAnd lastly here, here's PBF Energy. We looked at this last week and it's the same point I'm covering here with Netflix where Netflix hasn't broken out, it just runs sideways. But you have those tools to help you even pull money out of those periods even if nothing's happening in that particular market that you're trading. Well, here we come to PBF Energy. And again, you've got this last week where we've seen a lot of strength om energies, a little bit of volatility in crude oil contracts.\n\nBut in this market specifically, it's telling you, \"Look, over the past week, you want to be a buyer down at these levels.\" And seeing things again bounce and move to the upside as that overall trend remains very bullish here. And so again, it makes it clear to figure these things out like, \"Okay, there's weakness coming into the NASDAQ. There's strength coming in energies. Oh, this has shifted over here in the NASDAQ.\" And that can direct you to certain stocks and even whether it be big shifts and trend changes in the market, or just this short-term understanding that, \"Look, the environment shifted. You can now exploit those bullish opportunities and take those profits as we see this bout of strength come in.\"\n\nSo we'll just go ahead and leave it there. Just trying to highlight a lot of these different opportunities and how we've walked forward through this, but how it's really the combination of these tools. If you're trading stocks, certainly the forecast from the indexes can give you that valuable insight into how things are shifting and which broad areas like energies we've seen here. A lot of these stocks doubling in a very short period of time, just about a month on the calendar there.\n\nSo some really great things opening up. And again, seeing more recently it looks like some new opportunities again opening up to the upside, but you want to be able to manage those over the next month, two months of trading that we might see here. So once again, this has been our Hot Stocks Outlook for October 15th, 2021. Thank you all for watching, best of luck and bye for now.",

The current crop of leaders during the economy of this country is a paradigmatic shift from what was obtainable in the post-colonial era where the nationalists who agitated and achieved independence from Britain were in their youth, but in Nigerian politics today, the reverse is the case.\n\n\"The Youths are the leaders of tomorrow\" is an aphorism that contradicts the leadership monopoly practised by ageing Nigerian kleptocrats because the Nigerian government of present is led by gerontocrats who have continued to sideline the youth in the political and economic climate of Nigeria. Leadership is portrayed as the right of the elderly in Nigeria irrespective of societal changes since independence.\n\nGerontocrats in present-day Nigeria have made participation and representation unattainable and inaccessible to Nigerian youth with policies that alienate them.\n\nTaking a survey of youth representation in politics, the political leaders in present-day Nigeria are above 50 years of age. About 80% of the population of our political leaders are not youth because these same sets of political leaders are recycled. For instance, General Muhammadu Buhari's first regime as a leader of Nigeria, although military, was in his youth day in 1983. It is a shocking reality that 32 years later, the same Buhari is in power as the president in a democratic system.\n\nNow, the question \"Is the youth of Nigeria under siege?\" Wisdom, they posit, comes with age; but has this wisdom been transferred into Nigerian political and economic policies? Age should be an insignificant factor in the process of administration. However, the current realities show the problem of Nigeria is related to age as it limits or boosts the productivity rate of our leaders. Characteristics of leadership are experience, knowledge and legitimacy for the growth and development of the nation. Early leaders in the post-independence era were not aged, but youth driven by patriotism in their agitation for good governance.\n\nThe current leadership has eroded youthful participation and representation in modern-day politics with financial hindrance to contesting elections. The cost of elections is very exorbitant because of the money politics practised by Nigerian politicians. The financial ability to run for an election has made the opportunity to hold political offices a mirage. Injustice and maladministration have permeated society; thus, the youth are described as \"all bark but no bite\". Many Nigerian youths harnessed and amplify their voices through social media to demand good governance from these leaders of an older generation. The country riddled with insecurities, poverty, economic degeneration and political instability is one of the many reasons Nigerian youths must wake up to take over the nation's administration in the forthcoming elections. The development of Nigeria is in the hands of the young and active.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson's quote that \"the world belongs to the energetic\" is apt in the struggle and fight for good governance in 2023. Nigeria's leadership needs the young and energetic to catalyse development processes.\n\nThe country's economy has been left in the hands of political hyenas and piranhas in the guise of old and supposedly witty leaders who are bent on killing the economy with obnoxious policies.\n\nIf this is not the case, how do you explain the exponential increase of dollars at the expense of naira? How do you justify uncontrolled and incessant killing and kidnapping rampant in the nation; what is the rationale for the increased level of insecurities and brutality citizens suffer under the governance of this administration? The political outlook of Nigeria under this administration is tarnished, and the need for a facelift by people who have the tendencies to redeem Nigeria's image internationally is the youth who have been sidelined in the affairs of leadership.\n\nThis deplorable situation is a wake-up call from oblivion for Nigerian youth to harness their population to demand change with and inclusion of young innovative minds in the nation's political system. The Nigerian youth population must present themselves as a force to reckon with in the 2023 election by their political activism by raising candidates with people-driven representation and uncompromised prospects for good governance. This political overhaul of gerontocrats will not be without resistance or barriers ranging from suppression to finance; however, the youth-led representation must be resilient in demanding a change of government with their vote and active participation in the 2023 election poll.\n\nThe youth must never be sceptical of the political and economic powers they wield; and if in doubt at any point, they should take a walk down memory lane on October 22, 2020, of the END SARS protest organised and managed by Nigerian youth against police brutality. Frightened by the cooperation of the youth that successfully managed the peaceful protest irrespective of their ethnic and cultural differences before the government sent out thugs to infiltrate the process, the government disrupts the protest violently.\n\nA unified youth community pose a threat to their continuation in political office. The frightening nature of this unity has pushed them into exerting force and violence to suppress and disperse the youth with a blatant disregard for fundamental human rights.\n\nThat singular act shows the youth can take over; thus, this has kept them on their toes and given these kleptocratic and political elites the consciousness that they will be unseated, if the youths are determined to do so. The youth have been disenfranchised indirectly from active political participation and pursuance of leadership positions in politics. The leaders are quite aware of the challenges constraining the youth's active political participation. For Nigerian youths to have a chance to participate in political affairs, they must have the financial backbone to contest for the 'money politics' run in Nigeria and making this opportunity affordable; they must pool resources together to oust gerontocracy.\n\nIn addition, the END SARS protest demonstrated by Nigerian youth displays a non-violent revolutionary paradigm shift that will massively infiltrate the political arena and unseat the present crop of leaders \"ruining\" the nation to take over the leadership mantle. The END SARS protest is a pilot scheme test-running the power of the Nigerian youth community.\n\nWhile preparing for the 2023 election, the Nigerian youth must register their presence in the political milieu forming a political party that serves as a window of opportunity for the younger generation to contest elections. They must sensitise the public with visible and feasible manifestoes, innovative ideas and developmental goals for national advancement. Nigerian youth in the diaspora recording a level of success at the forefront of different disciplines abroad can come home and replicate the same in their country, it will facilitate a conducive atmosphere for national development.\n\nThis alone is a challenge for the Nigerian youth to wake up to their responsibilities to make their country fit and habitable for everyone. The youths in Nigeria must wake up to take over their future which has been truncated repeatedly by yesterday's leaders that have refused to hand over power to capable and energetic youth that can effectively drive the nation's affairs to land safely.\n\n'The functionality of any country is in its economy through trade and commerce. As the world is changing to a global market, the future of information technology, artificial intelligence and financial technology is beyond the mental capability of these gerontocrats who have crashed the economy of this country through many obnoxious economic policies that seem to plunge Nigeria gradually into economic depression. The future of the global market is bleak in Nigeria as long as this crop of leaders are our economic drivers. Nigerian political kleptocrats lack the understanding of taking advantage of e-commerce and financial technology favourable to the economic development of the country because this can be deduced as the reason why the Nigerian government will ban cryptocurrency trading in Nigeria irrespective of the economic value.\n\nThey do not see its prospect to the growth of the economy; rather, they see it as an avenue to stifle the Nigerian youth through their source of living. What a pathetic way to victimise the so-called leaders of tomorrow! How many of these old leaders make their money from financial technology? They do not understand the workings of this new development that has given the youth financial stability where they have failed, and placing a ban on the financial independence of the youth will keep them in subservience to the whims and caprices of these kleptocrats. The youth are subjugated consistently by unfavourable policies implemented against their source of livelihood as a way of taking away their economic independence.\n\nIt was a deliberate attempt by these selfish and power-drunk bigots to keep the youth alienated and nonchalant about politics. The prospect for improved governance is that Nigerian youth must wake up to take charge of their political destiny, infiltrate the nooks and crannies of politics and decision making in the country, and participate actively in politics which is the first step for Nigerian youth to wake up from their political slumbering and take a step further to form and register a political party with a different ideology to that of the past. Fielding credible candidates that will create an enabling environment for political and economic growth will be the game-changer in the takeover.",

                "body": "Christine Bryant Times Correspondent\n\nFinding polyps during a routine colonoscopy can feel a bit like \"hide and seek.\"\n\nWhile doctors do locate most polyps, it's the ones that stay hidden and out of sight that especially cause concern among those in the medical community.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer diagnosed in the United States, with almost 150,000 new cases every year, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n\nDuring a colonoscopy, gastroenterologists look for polyps, which are small clumps of cells that form on the lining of the colon. While most are harmless, over time, some polyps can develop into colon cancer, which if found too late, can be deadly.\n\nAt times, polyps can be extremely small or tucked under folds in the colon's lining. This can make them difficult to detect.\n\nNew technology, however, is aiding specialists in finding these well-hidden polyps, and doctors say it could save lives.\n\nPorter is the first hospital in Indiana to offer patients receiving a colonoscopy an enhanced screening with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) built into a new endoscopy module. Called GI Genius, this new module employs AI technology to help physicians detect polyps they may have otherwise missed.\n\n\"It aids you in picking up an extra polyp here and there that you may not have seen before,\" says Dr. Hadi Siddiqui, a gastroenterologist with Northwest Health. \"There are many twists and turns in the colon and sometimes you miss polyps that in those folds.\"\n\nWhile Siddiqui said he may find nearly all polyps during a routine colonoscopy, this AI technology can assist him in locating ones that are out of sight.\n\n\"I've performed about 20 cases with this software on, and in one or two cases, I found polyps I may not have seen because either they're really small or they're hiding in a fold,\" he said.\n\nDuring a colonoscopy, doctors insert a long, flexible tube into the rectum. A small video camera at the tip provides the doctor with a view of the entire colon.\n\nThe advanced AI software highlights suspicious polyps with a visual marker in real-time, serving as a second observer to the gastroenterologist. The software uses AI algorithm techniques to identify potential lesions.\n\n\"What they've done is photograph thousands and thousands of polyps and made software that basically recognizes these bumps in the colon,\" Siddiqui said. \"The software compares the image that it's seeing live to a database that has thousands of pictures of polyps in it.\"\n\nWhen the AI software identifies a potential lesion, a green square will appear on the video from the endoscope camera. This signals to the gastroenterologist that further assessment may be needed.\n\n\"This new technology is the first and only AI system for detection of colonic polyps in the United States and we are proud to offer it to our patients,\" said Ashley Dickinson, CEO of Northwest Health, in a news release.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that adults age 45 to 75 be screened for colorectal cancer.\n\n\"As soon as people turn 45, they should go get a colonoscopy,\" Siddiqui said. \"It's the best way to detect cancer that people often get for no rhyme or reason. The best way to prevent colon cancer is to get a colonoscopy.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

Sheikh Mansoor bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Chairman of the Higher Committee for the Protection of the Rights of People of Determination, led the White Cane March held today at Expo 2020 Dubai on the occasion of International White Cane Day.\n\nThe march was organised by the Ministry of Community Development in collaboration with the Emirates Association of Visually Impaired. The International White Cane Day is observed worldwide every year on 15 October to recognise the achievements of visually impaired people and their movement from dependency to active participation in society.\n\nSheikh Mansoor bin Mohammed said: \"The UAE's leadership is committed to creating an empowering environment for people of determination to participate equally in all sectors and spheres of life. The UAE believes in the power of inclusiveness, and in implementing it in its full spirit to provide people of determination with opportunities to realise their talent and potential and contribute to shaping the future of the nation. We will continue to spare no effort in enabling people of determination to not only function in society with ease and independence but also live their lives to the fullest.\"\n\nHis Highness was accompanied by Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, Minister of Tolerance and Coexistence; Hessa bint Essa Buhumaid, Minister of Community Development; Reem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy, Minister of State for International Cooperation, and Director General of Expo 2020 Dubai; and Abdullah Abdul-Ali Al Humaidan, Secretary-General of the Zayed Higher Organization for People of Determination.\n\nThe White Cane March featured the military band of Dubai Police. Etisalat supported the event as a Main Partner. A number of senior officials, visually impaired people and Expo visitors also participated in the event.\n\nHessa bint Essa Buhumaid emphasised that the White Cane March reflects the UAE's social values and its commitment to the welfare of various segments of the community. The event offered participants an opportunity to express their support for and solidarity with the visually impaired. she stressed on the need to inculcate a community culture that promotes sensitivity to the needs of people of determination and facilitates their independence, backed by the services, policies and initiatives of the UAE government and various entities.\n\nShe said: \"Expo 2020 Dubai has paid special attention to organising a people of determination-friendly event by offering them privileges, services and facilities designed to make their experience exceptional. Expo 2020 Dubai seeks to be the best ever World Expo in history in terms of accessibility for people of determination. The symbolic march organised today reaffirms the UAE leadership's commitment to ensuring the happiness and wellbeing of all people of determination.\"\n\nBuhumaid noted that the UAE seeks to promote active social participation of people of determination and provide them equal opportunities within an inclusive environment. The word 'people of determination' was coined to empower them to play an active role in the community and overcome all challenges.\n\nThe Minister of Community Development added that this national policy has been implemented in an integrated manner to ensure that buildings across the country are accessible to people of determination. The UAE's Universal Design Code supports this policy by creating a set of unified guidelines for designing accessible buildings, facilities and services, she added.\n\nReem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy, Minister of State for International Cooperation, and Director General of Expo 2020 Dubai said: \"The extensive and high-level participation in the White Cane March shows the UAE's commitment to integrating all members of the community without any exception and ensuring their wellbeing and happiness. This is clearly reflected in our efforts to promote human development and dignity.\n\nShe stressed that Expo 2020 Dubai seeks to promote an international dialogue to create new opportunities and build a future centred on human dignity, while also fostering an environment that stimulates creativity, innovation and empowered leadership. \"These themes are strongly reflected in the organisation of Expo 2020 Dubai. We have sought to address the needs of different segments of society and provided various facilities and services to ensure ease of access for all and a safe, seamless and exceptional visitor experience.\"\n\nAl Hashemy added that efforts to address the needs of people of determination also extend to the events and programmes at Expo 2020. People of determination have also been provided all opportunities to be part of the workforce of the event.\n\nAbdul Rahman Ahmed Al Bastaki, Director of the Emirates Association of Visually Impaired, said: \"Celebrating the International White Cane Day demonstrates the sincere desire of social entities and individuals to raise public awareness about the importance of using the white cane; the white cane is not a symbol of visual impairment but one of the most important tools for their freedom and independence. Its users have confidence in themselves without the need to seek others' help. Each year, the Association is keen to organise the White Cane March as well as educate the community on the importance of the white cane and its symbolic significance.\n\nHe added that the march held at Expo is part of a new effort to raise awareness about the needs of people of determination among visitors of all nationalities within the framework of the Association's community awareness building programmes. At the end of the march, Etisalat gave away gifts to people of determination in recognition of their participation, emphasising the need for interaction, support and empowerment of people of determination in the UAE.\n\nDr. Ahmed bin Ali, Senior Vice President Corporate Communications at ETISALAT said: \"Etisalat is honoured to be a main partner for this event. We seek to harness our vast technical capabilities to support and serve people of determination. Our participation in the International White Cane Day on 15 October each year reflects our keenness to further strengthen our corporate social responsibility towards all the members of the community and find innovative solutions to enable people of determination to use telecommunications services and technical facilities easily and smoothly based on our strategy to empower communities and usher in a new digital future.\"\n\nBin Ali added: \"Etisalat lauds the efforts of the Ministry of Community Development and its pivotal role in supporting people of determination in various forums and events through many distinct initiatives. Etisalat places high priority on people of determination, as part of which we are keen to provide them a range of exceptional innovative services and develop new solutions to empower them by leveraging on advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IOT), augmented reality, virtual reality and 5G.\n\nExpo 2020 Dubai offers free tickets to people of determination, while one of their companions can avail a 50% discount.

                "body": "The Defense Department is expanding the number of bases using 5G with a contract to provide the service to seven Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) installations.\n\nAnnounced Sept. 21, the contract puts Verizon Public Sector in charge of delivering its 5G Ultra Wideband mobility service to bases in California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. The deployment will feature C-band radios installed outdoors at each AFRC location and a combination of 4G and 5G mmWave frequency indoors, bringing higher speeds, increased bandwidth and lower latency for base personnel and the surrounding community.\n\n\"Connectivity is a challenge across our bases, where approximately two-thirds of our facilities do not have sufficient coverage or capacity for mobile device productivity and communication,\" said Kenneth Morgan, AFRC's chief information technology officer. \"Enabling connectivity allows the operator, maintainer, defender or first responder to enhance capabilities. Historically, the communication has been limited to land mobile radio, voice-only devices. The enriched capabilities of voice, text and video are significant.\"\n\nThe additional capabilities of 4G and 5G will enable reservists to work more efficiently at the edge. For instance, they won't have to travel to a facility with wired connectivity to document aircraft maintenance. They can have a library of aircraft flight and maintenance manuals, which can consist of thousands of pages equal to 30 to 60 gigabytes, at their fingertips on their device.\n\nOther potential benefits Morgan cited include real-time collaboration with tools such as Microsoft Teams that reservists can use to support engineers fixing a jet thousands of miles away, operators accessing the latest weather updates from the end of the runway, airmen performing nonroutine tasks by watching a how-to video while stepping through technical manual procedures, and the consolidation of devices and information into a single form factor.\n\n\"In the past, the airman would have a land mobile radio, paper technical manuals, paper aircraft flight plan,\" Morgan said. \"Engineering support required a lengthy paper-based process.\"\n\nThe connectivity will also allow for the developments of augmented and virtual reality simulators and trainers; full-motion, high-definition video to support telemedicine; and ultra-fast artificial intelligence for biometric identification.\n\nWhat's more, the bases can now operate as smart cities, freeing personnel from routine operations by using autonomous systems, Morgan said. \"The addition of commercial cellular infrastructure consisting of macro towers, small cells and in-building solutions is a game-changer.\"\n\nThe work builds on DOD's Offer to Lease (OTL) project, a three-phase approach to connectivity. The first two phases went to Verizon in 2019, and three of AFRC's 10 host base installations are complete. The seven that remain are part of what's called Phase 2b.\n\n\"In coordination with Headquarters Air Force and [the Air Force Civil Engineering Center], the command proposed a singular major command approach to not only accelerate the command, but potentially accelerate the larger Air Force project as well,\" Morgan said. \"Now with Air Force Reserve, the Air Force has a total of 37 bases under the OTL project with commercial industry. Specifically for the Air Force Reserve, this will establish a baseline across all of our host bases and headquarters, facilitating the standardization of capabilities available to the warfighter.\"\n\nLessons learned from the previous work include better understanding of how bases conduct the facilities utilization board integration of support requirements, DOD/Air Force radio frequency spectrum analysis, environmental requirements and how to use commercial infrastructure to meet mission current and emerging needs, he said.\n\nMorgan said he expects that by the end of 2023, the phases of the project that pertain to AFRC bases will be complete, expanding coverage and capacity for more than 500 facilities supporting more than 30,000 Reserve Citizen Airmen.\n\nPhase 2b aligns with two larger efforts. One is the Air Force chief of staff's strategic approach known as \"Accelerate Change or Lose.\" Released in August 2020, it calls for \"innovation, experimentation and rapid prototyping, and a collaborative approach with our service and industry teammates\" to be defense-ready.\n\nThe other is a strategic priority to reform \"our organizations to optimize our warfighting capabilities\" that Richard Scobee, chief of the Air Force Reserve and commander of AFRC, and Command Chief Timothy White set.\n\nOther branches of the military are also testing 5G. The Naval Postgraduate School is working with AT&T on maritime solutions, and a year ago DOD announced $600 million for 5G experimentation and testing at five sites, including Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, Ga., which has studied 5G-enabled smart warehousing.",

                "title": "Putting artificial intelligence at the heart of health care  --  with help from MIT ",
                "body": "Caption: Cardiologist Demilade Adedinsewo (right) is a Mayo Clinic Florida Women's Health Scholar whose research interests include the use of digital tools in cardiovascular disease management.\n\nArtificial intelligence is transforming industries around the world -- and health care is no exception. A recent Mayo Clinic study found that AI-enhanced electrocardiograms (ECGs) have the potential to save lives by speeding diagnosis and treatment in patients with heart failure who are seen in the emergency room.\n\nThe lead author of the study is Demilade \"Demi\" Adedinsewo, a noninvasive cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic who is actively integrating the latest AI advancements into cardiac care and drawing largely on her learning experience with MIT Professional Education.\n\nIdentifying AI opportunities in health care\n\nA dedicated practitioner, Adedinsewo is a Mayo Clinic Florida Women's Health Scholar and director of research for the Cardiovascular Disease Fellowship program. Her clinical research interests include cardiovascular disease prevention, women's heart health, cardiovascular health disparities, and the use of digital tools in cardiovascular disease management.\n\nAdedinsewo's interest in AI emerged toward the end of her cardiology fellowship, when she began learning about its potential to transform the field of health care. \"I started to wonder how we could leverage AI tools in my field to enhance health equity and alleviate cardiovascular care disparities,\" she says.\n\nDuring her fellowship at the Mayo Clinic, Adedinsewo began looking at how AI could be used with ECGs to improve clinical care. To determine the effectiveness of the approach, the team retroactively used deep learning to analyze ECG results from patients with shortness of breath. They then compared the results with the current standard of care -- a blood test analysis -- to determine if the AI enhancement improved the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart is unable to adequately pump blood to the rest of the body. While she understood the clinical implications of the research, she found the AI components challenging.\n\n\"Even though I have a medical degree and a master's degree in public health, those credentials aren't really sufficient to work in this space,\" Adedinsewo says. \"I began looking for an opportunity to learn more about AI so that I could speak the language, bridge the gap, and bring those game-changing tools to my field.\"\n\nBridging the gap at MIT\n\nAdedinsewo's desire to bring together advanced data science and clinical care led her to MIT Professional Education, where she recently completed the Professional Certificate Program in Machine Learning & AI. To date, she has completed nine courses, including AI Strategies and Roadmap.\n\n\"All of the courses were great,\" Adedinsewo says. \"I especially appreciated how the faculty, like professors Regina Barzilay, Tommi Jaakkola, and Stefanie Jegelka, provided practical examples from health care and non-health care fields to illustrate what we were learning.\"\n\nAdedinsewo's goals align closely with those of Barzilay, the AI lead for the MIT Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. \"There are so many areas of health care that can benefit from AI,\" Barzilay says. \"It's exciting to see practitioners like Demi join the conversation and help identify new ideas for high-impact AI solutions.\"\n\nAdedinsewo also valued the opportunity to work and learn within the greater MIT community alongside accomplished peers from around the world, explaining that she learned different things from each person. \"It was great to get different perspectives from course participants who deploy AI in other industries,\" she says.\n\nPutting knowledge into action\n\nArmed with her updated AI toolkit, Adedinsewo was able to make meaningful contributions to Mayo Clinic's research. The team successfully completed and published their ECG project in August 2020, with promising results. In analyzing the ECGs of about 1,600 patients, the AI-enhanced method was both faster and more effective -- outperforming the standard blood tests with a performance measure (AUC) of 0.89 versus 0.80. This improvement could enhance health outcomes by improving diagnostic accuracy and increasing the speed with which patients receive appropriate care.\n\nBut the benefits of Adedinsewo's MIT experience go beyond a single project. Adedinsewo says that the tools and strategies she acquired have helped her communicate the complexities of her work more effectively, extending its reach and impact. \"I feel more equipped to explain the research -- and AI strategies in general -- to my clinical colleagues. Now, people reach out to me to ask, 'I want to work on this project. Can I use AI to answer this question?'' she said.\n\nLooking to the AI-powered future\n\nWhat's next for Adedinsewo's research? Taking AI mainstream within the field of cardiology. While AI tools are not currently widely used in evaluating Mayo Clinic patients, she believes they hold the potential to have a significant positive impact on clinical care.\n\n\"These tools are still in the research phase,\" Adedinsewo says. \"But I'm hoping that within the next several months or years we can start to do more implementation research to see how well they improve care and outcomes for cardiac patients over time.\"\n\nBhaskar Pant, executive director of MIT Professional Education, says \"We at MIT Professional Education feel particularly gratified that we are able to provide practitioner-oriented insights and tools in machine learning and AI from expert MIT faculty to frontline health researchers such as Dr. Demi Adedinsewo, who are working on ways to enhance markedly clinical care and health outcomes in cardiac and other patient populations. This is also very much in keeping with MIT's mission of 'working with others for the betterment of humankind!'\"",

                "body": "AUSTIN, Texas - Oct. 14, 2021 - PRLog -- CrowdPoint Technologies, Inc. (\"CrowdPoint\"), a Blockchain Ecosystem and Exchange provider, announced today the launch of its nextgen blockchain technology through its 11 sectors, public-private exchange strategy through the Blockchain Ecosystem Exchange (\"BEX\").\n\nCrowdPoint's digital platform combines the power of big data, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology to create a shared services platform for decentralized exchanges and marketplaces. With international development teams across North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Asian perimeter, CrowdPoint's goal is to democratize data behind human identity.\n\n\"At CrowdPoint, we deliver nextgen blockchain technologies. For the average global citizen, blockchain can be confusing and bewildering. It must seem everyone is becoming a billionaire overnight. This is likely because of the noise around businesses and currency models that use blockchain,\" says Sean Brehm, the Chairman & CEO of CrowdPoint Technologies. \"We at CrowdPoint felt we had to make it understandable. While the potential of blockchain is disruptive and revolutionary, we believe the current use of blockchain and the subsequent wealth creation resulting from its adoption is potentially flawed and unsustainable. Our approach is simple: drive improved e-commerce using big data and blockchain to create revenue first and worry about speculation later.\"\n\nThe company has spent the last year in stealth integrating 11 market sector exchanges with its shared services technologies - nextgen blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligence. The shared services also include technologies that help small and medium-sized companies grow and compete like large enterprises. The company has deployed its web-based communication service that comes prepopulated with millions of ideal customer profiles. This feat is possible through a big data customer resource manager. Also included is a website builder that provides web hosting and design services. Users can quickly build their site while integrating directly into nextgen blockchain technology. The company has already onboarded over 1000 Distributors and Resellers to date. CrowdPoint helps them sell their products online on BEX.\n\nCrowdPoint is passionate about the success of blockchain technology and views the current cryptocurrency hype as having the potential for similar pitfalls that caused the dot-com bubble. The company created BEX to get \"Left of Bang\" and decrease the likelihood of another potential bust. Through a solid public-private blockchain-powered assembly of exchanges and marketplaces, CrowdPoint focuses on more efficient e-commerce.\n\nFor more information, you can visit the following links:\n\nhttps://crowdpointtech.com\n\nhttps://blockchainecosystem.exchange\n\nThis article may contain \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, and these statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

                "title": "Pritzker's EV plan could give Illinois' economy a much-needed jolt",
                "body": "Electric vehicles are the future of manufacturing. Illinois must do all it can to capture its share of that business.\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker is right to do all he can to promote Illinois as a hub of electric vehicle manufacturing. He's doing just that with a new and massive incentive package that Crain's Greg Hinz reckons may be the largest ever offered in the state's history. Included are a wide range of tax breaks, from payroll credits and exemptions from utility and some sales taxes, to assistance with job training, and favored treatment in obtaining government permits and road construction funds.\n\nAs Crain's has noted many times before, the state is well positioned to be a leader in development of the technology that underpins so much of what promises to be the next generation of on-road transportation in the United States and the world: electric-powered cars and trucks, smart highways, and self-driving vehicles.\n\nThe state's most notable entry in this category is Rivian. At the company's sole manufacturing plant in downstate Normal, electric pickup trucks are now rolling off the assembly line and being sold throughout the U.S., even as the company moves forward with plans to produce 100,000 electric delivery trucks to one of its key financial backers, Amazon.\n\nEarlier this year, New York-based hydrogen vehicle maker Hyzon Motors said it will begin producing fuel cell components in Bolingbrook at what promises to be the largest plant of its kind in the U.S. Lion Electric, a Canadian maker of electric-powered school buses, plans a manufacturing plant in Joliet that will employ 800 people.\n\nMeanwhile, Here Technologies, the digital mapping company that used to be known as Navteq, is developing GPS-enabled navigation devices with partners like BMW to make driverless cars a reality. And Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's engineering school are working together on fuel cell development. Also, global delivery giant DHL is operating an innovation center here -- one of just three worldwide -- to explore how artificial intelligence can reshape the business of moving goods around.\n\nSo Illinois already has natural advantages in the race for 21st-century transportation investment. But, with Rivian eyeing Texas, not Illinois, for its second manufacturing plant, and with Ford Motor Co. recently announcing billions of dollars of electric-vehicle assembly investment in Tennessee and Kentucky -- not at the Detroit giant's existing mega-facility on Chicago's Far South Side -- warning signs are flashing that Illinois must do more to keep its edge in this rapidly growing field.\n\nThat's why Pritzker must act swiftly to tout Illinois' know-how now, while automotive giants like Ford and its rivals are pondering where to make these multibillion-dollar investments, decisions that will have major economic ripple effects for decades. And a smart centerpiece of Pritzker's plan is to shore up the state's existing automotive assembly centers -- the Ford plant along Torrence Avenue and Stellantis' similar facility at Belvidere just outside Rockford -- to entice their owners to convert these factories to electric-vehicle production hubs of the future.\n\nTo pull that off, Pritzker's plan offers a refundable state income tax credit of 75% or 100% of withholding from workers at electric manufacturing and supply plants, for up to 15 years. As Crain's first explained, the larger, 100% figure would apply to newly hired workers at a facility located in an \"underserved area\" of the state. Belvidere, the South Side Ford plant, and Normal, Crain's Hinz notes, would all qualify for that \"underserved\" designation.\n\nAnother focus of the legislation is luring Samsung, which is currently weighing bids from Illinois and Ohio to build an enormous battery factory that officials here want to land across the road from Rivian. That facility could employ as many as 7,500 people.\n\nAutomotive production has for decades been a pillar of the Midwest economy, even in Illinois, which may not boast as many assembly plants as other states, but which is home to a vast army of parts makers and suppliers. Shepherding these metal-benders toward the industry's electric-powered future is a key economic development challenge for Illinois. One glance through the pages of Crain's sister publication, Automotive News, the industry bible, confirms it: Headline after headline focuses on EV development. So Team Pritzker is correct to encourage a retooling of our existing manufacturing infrastructure, while also demonstrating to companies like Samsung that Illinois is the right place to invest.\n\nWhat would be even better would be to address the other, more fundamental issues that have tended to make Illinois less attractive than other states: Our pension-weakened state finances and our well-earned reputation for political corruption, just for starters. That's the long game. But in the meantime, if incentives can help us overcome those demerits, then the Legislature should get behind this plan.",

                "title": "Transhumanists gather in Spain to plan global transformation - Russia News Now",
                "body": "TransVision 2021 saw technologists push radical visions for our future. Apparently, the clueless public is to be propagandized -- not consulted.\n\nTranshumanism is a futuristic religion that exalts technology as the highest power. The movement's goal is to merge man with machine. Their wildest prophecies seem ridiculous at first, until you consider the dizzying advances in bionics, robotics, neuroprosthetics, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and genetic engineering.\n\nProminent figures gathered at the TransVision 2021 conference in Madrid over the weekend. Listening to the proceedings online, I heard a broad range of totalizing schemes. There were no Luddites or Amish onstage, but of course, Spain is a long haul for a horse-and-buggy. Besides, no unvaccinated person can legally cross the Spanish border.\n\nTranshumanists hold that the human condition of ignorance, loneliness, sadness, disease, old age, and death can be transcended through improved gadgetry. Many believe tribalism will also be eliminated -- perhaps through brain implants -- but this elite clique tends to be so convicted, legacy humans will have no say in the matter.\n\nTheir radical ideas are hardly marginal. Transhuman values have been implicitly embraced by the world's wealthiest technologists. Consider Bill Gates pushing universal jabs, Jeff Bezos's quest for \"life extension,\" Elon Musk's proposed brain implants, Mark Zuckerberg's forays into the Metaverse, and Eric Schmidt's plans for an American technocracy racing against China.\n\nIf Big Tech is the established church, transhumanists are Desert Fathers in the wilderness.\n\nAllowing for variation, transhumanists confess there is no God but the future Computer God. They believe neuroprosthetics will allow communion with this artificial deity. They believe robot companions should be normalized. They believe longevity tech will confer approximate immortality. They believe virtual reality provides a life worth living. Above all, they believe the Singularity is near.\n\nAccording to the Cult of the Singularity and its prophet, Ray Kurzweil, we'll see artificial general intelligence by 2029. Unlike narrow algorithms performing specific tasks, AGI will be robust cognition enacted by neural networks, far faster than any human brain.\n\nBy 2045 (or 2049), we will hit the Singularity -- when artificial superintelligence surpasses human intellect to the point we cannot comprehend its output. Purely organic humans will be left in the smart dust. Our only chance for long-term survival is to fuse our minds and bodies with the All-Powerful Machine -- to become a new posthuman species.\n\nTherefore, our meaning in life is to make sure the future Computer God is benevolent, while we still have time. (In most cases, \"benevolent\" is synonymous with \"lefty globalist.\") Today's machine learning systems are prompted by programmers, then trained with our language and behavior via mass data extraction.\n\nAs computers advance to superintelligence, the story goes, their output will tilt toward humanity's moral compass. Eventually, this digital deity may colonize distant galaxies -- turning all usable matter into computerized mind -- so our actions today might determine the fate of the entire universe.\n\nI'm reminded of the subterranean mutants who worshiped the atom bomb in \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes.\" Many mammals use tools to survive, but even a chimp knows better than to raise up a stick and call it \"God.\"\n\nTechnocracy and Its Discontents\n\nBack on Earth, the early phase of this scheme is far from heaven. Just as the TV kept Americans pacified and glued to their couches, the digital revolution has profound demoralizing and dehumanizing effects.\n\nTo their credit, TransVision invited a handful of critics to ring alarm bells. The ethicist Sara Lumbreras discussed the devastating impact of smartphones and social media on attention span, memory, and self-control. \"If you can just Google the information, why does it matter?\" she asked. \"Because remembering things is the only way that we can use that information for critical thinking and for creative thinking.\"\n\nBoth transhumanists and Luddites see 24/7 reliance on smartphones as an early phase of our symbiosis with machines. For all the convenience gained, many schoolteachers worry that the shift to digital platforms is making kids antisocial and functionally illiterate. An entire generation is being lost to self-pleasure.\n\nThe Wireheading Myth\n\nOxford philosopher Anders Sandberg discussed a 1954 experiment in neuroprosthetics. Using electro-stimulation, the scientist James Olds discovered the pleasure center in a rat's brain. He wired up numerous rats, enabling them to stimulate themselves by pressing a lever. These rodent \"wireheads\" ceased to do anything besides push the lever. One by one, they died with smiles on their faces.\n\nVideo games and corporate opioids find us in a similar predicament. Even in the Victorian era, Sandberg explained, intellectuals wondered if humans were already becoming parasites on machines. \"They connected that to discoveries in biology that parasites quite often seem to be simplified forms of older species [and they thought] we might become some kind of barnacle sitting on the technological infrastructure, slowly losing our brains.\"\n\nHence, the \"Wireheading Myth\" -- the narrative that civilization could collapse due to techno-hedonism. Sandberg insisted that while this story isn't completely untrue, it isn't inevitable either. \"Building real happiness is a really complex thing, but we know we can make it increase.\"\n\nIn conclusion, he wondered, \"Can we use the transhuman ambition to say ... 'I want to be way happier, I want entire societies to be happier. ... I want my artificial intelligences to go for the true and daimonic good?'\"\n\nFrom Atari to Alpha Centauri\n\nSandberg is an optimist, but not without reservations. He has contemplated the dangers of artificial superintelligence rigorously. This digital entity would be entirely unpredictable to mere human minds, and perhaps uncontrollable. In a real sense, advanced AI is comparable to the development of thermonuclear warheads.\n\nA humorous hypothetical is an AI system that makes paperclips. What if it goes haywire and turns everything on Earth into paperclips, including us? More realistically, what if an advanced AI is programmed to solve climate change, then arrives at the straightforward conclusion that humans must be exterminated?\n\nSandberg takes these existential risks seriously, but in the end, he's ready to go for it.\n\nA Kinder, Gentler Cyborg\n\nThe term \"transhumanism\" evokes such revulsion, normal people immediately recoil. So the alpha-dog transhumanist Max More -- a leading figure at Alcor cryonics lab -- urged the audience to abandon loaded words like \"immortality\" in favor of \"life extension.\" Meanwhile, 184 deceased customers lay frozen at his facility, some $200,000 in the hole, waiting to be resurrected.\n\nWe mortals have more pressing concerns. Discussing the displacement of actual people by robots and artificial intelligence, Jerome Glenn of the Millennium Project was emphatic that \"artists, media moguls, and entertainers\" should psychologically prepare the public to accept economic obsolescence.\n\nThe loudest alarm was sounded by tech ethicist Nell Watson, an Apple consultant and chairwoman at IEEE. \"The global health crises are being used as an excuse for greater authoritarianism,\" she said, shocking everyone awake. \"[T]his could end up as a Trojan Horse for some kind of social credit-style monitoring system.\"\n\n\"Today, it's immunity therapies,\" Watson warned, \"but in 10 or 15 years, it might be people who reject some kind of brain-computer interface ... or a financial technology that's linked to biometrics.\" She worried that transhumanists might become scapegoats for oppressive policies they are not responsible for.\n\nIn response, Anders Sandberg took to Twitter to defend vaccine mandates in the workplace. The conference proceeded apace.\n\nThe Future Has Already Arrived\n\nAs a broad ideology, transhumanism is as relevant for the 21st century as communism was for the 20th century. In the mid-1800s, Karl Marx and his crew were mere socialist intellectuals. By 1923, the Bolsheviks had taken over Russia. By 1949, Mao had taken over China. In our age of all-pervasive technology, entire societies are revolutionized before anyone can grasp the change.\n\nThe futurists who gathered in Madrid last weekend -- along with those preaching technocracy at the World Economic Forum -- are laying the intellectual groundwork for a fully digitized social order. Today, it's the Fourth Industrial Revolution -- a global paradigm of total transformation -- embraced by Microsoft, Alibaba, Sony, General Motors, Mozilla, and Salesforce, among many others. Tomorrow, the faithful proclaim, it will be artificial superintelligence, brain implants, and unstoppable killer drones.\n\nThe labels don't matter. To the extent that Silicon Valley, the Chinese tech sector, and various quirky start-ups converge on the central goal -- to merge human beings with digital devices -- you could say transhumanism is already a ruling ideology. One has only to look past this text and focus on the glowing screen to see their fantasies are becoming reality.\n\nJoe Allen is a fellow primate who wonders why we ever came down from the trees.

                "body": "JPMorgan Chase is one of the largest banks in the world, commanding more than $2.6 trillion in assets. It is also the largest bank in the U.S. and as such plays a significant role in the country's economy as a nexus for investing, trading and banking. Take a look at Chase's market performance to help you decide if you should invest in the biggest bank in America.\n\nA company's market cap represents the aggregate value of its outstanding shares of stock. You can determine how investors assess a company based on the dollar amount at which its shares are trading.\n\nChase's market cap range might reflect its strong consumer value as the country's largest bank. Chase stock has been trending steadily upward since 2014, save for a steep decline during the pandemic, and it experienced an especially large jump in value between October 2020 and October 2021.\n\nAlthough market cap gives you a clear sense of what the market values a company at, it is subject to change from prospective and current investors' activity, resulting in hour-by-hour changes. The GOBankingRates Evaluation of company net worth, however, is a calculation based on more concrete, measurable figures like assets and revenue. It's a more conservative valuation, taking into account only full-year profits and revenue from the last three years and the company's assets and debts.\n\nBased on Chase's revenue and profits from the last three years, its net worth is over $495 billion.\n\nChase reported third-quarter 2021 earnings that exceeded analysts' earnings and revenue expectations. The strong results were driven in part by Chase's release of $2.1 billion in credit reserves due to an improved economic outlook, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. However, Dimon acknowledged that the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus and ongoing supply-chain disruptions have had a dampening effect\n\nDespite those challenges, Chase reported continued growth, this quarter becoming the first bank to have branches in every state in the contiguous U.S., with over 200 of the 400 new branches planned by the end of 2022 already open. In addition, Chase has made a number of acquisitions recently, including a restaurant review service, college planning platform and three fintech startups, CNBC reported.\n\nChase Bank offers its members products such as savings accounts, certificates of deposit, checking accounts, a variety of loans and credit cards. Customers with Chase credit cards can get competitive perks along with their credit line, such as cash rewards and promotional 0% APRs, depending on creditworthiness. Additionally, the bank offers investment products as well as business banking services.\n\nThe company's range of products and services combined with its mobile banking and payment options -- such as Chase QuickPay with Zelle and Chase Pay -- demonstrate how the bank is keeping up with its top competitors in terms of its offerings. It's also exploring how it can be a fintech leader. In addition to its investment in fintech startups, JPMorgan Chase recently introduced its mobile app users to Chase Digital Assistant, an artificial intelligence-based tool that can answer account-related queries and respond to requests.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also sits on its board of directors.

                "body": "When it comes to trading, many people feel intimidated by the complexities of the market, so they never get involved. By adding another layer with foreign markets, most people are likely to give up. But Darik Alexander has discovered that by using AI technology, trading in the foreign markets can be made accessible to anyone.\n\nAs a full-time entrepreneur for the last 7 years, Darik saw an opportunity to integrate artificial intelligence with real data in the foreign exchange markets. Through this vision, Market Hackers was born. He wanted to find a way to give people total control over their investments in an easy-to-use way. Darik's Market Hackers have access to AI technology that allows them to set their risk level and strategy management, as well as identify and take advantage of trends. There is also a pattern recognition function, alerting users to potential market breakouts.\n\nDarik's Market Hackers have the option of joining his \"Inner Circle,\" as well. As a unique offering to members on the Inner Circle, Darik has created a specialized program called Project 600. Each member has access to this free program, which will help them learn to make real money. \"The goal isn't to make people millionaires at first, it's just making 600 a month so they can do it fast and see that it's real and then help them scale to more,\" says Darik Alexander.\n\nDarik teaches his clients how to make passive income online fast and seamlessly. He's taken everything he's learned about digital marketing from sales psychology to boosting fan pages to thousands of likes and packages it in his Project 600 course. \"I knew that if I could master how to scale businesses online, using digital marketing and social media that would separate me from the rest of the competition,\" says Darik Alexander.\n\nTo make Market Hackers a success, Darik has worked with some of the best coders, who also have vast knowledge of foreign exchange markets. This has given him, and his Market Hackers, absolute control and absolute freedom.",

                "body": "Artificial Intelligence and machine learning is paving their way in almost all industries. Its next target is the high-tech industry. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence in the engineering and mechanical world has raised many questions. What is the scope of Artificial Intelligence in the high-tech industry? Is it a good idea to invest in AI? Will AI replace the engineers? Is it easy for Artificial intelligence to overtake all the high-tech fields?\n\nThere is no doubt that Artificial intelligence is developing rapidly. It is capable of versatile applications and has marked remarkable changes in many industries. We have the example of Google, Amazon, and Facebook algorithms in front of us. But with the current developments in AI, it cannot overtake the high-tech mechanical and engineering industry anytime soon. It may modify the traditional tools of the industry, but it is useless without the human workforce.\n\nIn this article, we have evaluated the scope of Artificial Intelligence in the high-tech industry. We have also discussed the obstacles to adopting AI in the industry.\n\nAI is now part of almost every industry, including high-tech. It has made significant progress in recent years and seems to have a good scope in the tech field.\n\nThe most significant development of Artificial Intelligence is in the research field. Today, AI tools and software are much more efficient in holding the data and evaluating it. They help the researchers in making the most of the existing research. Researchers can now focus more on finding new solutions than investing time in extracting information from previous work with the help of AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence can process and evaluate data much more quickly and efficiently than the human brain. It can hold much more data than traditional computing devices and process it in just a few seconds. Now whether you want to correlate the existing database with centuries-old data. Or need to drive results based on an extensive database, AI software and tools are there to assist you. They can serve as the efficient assistants of data analysts and may take over their roles one day.\n\nAI tools and software work with much larger databases and are expected to make accurate judgments in most cases. For instance, a human brain may get confused in identifying a metal or chemical. But AI tools can detect it accurately and efficiently.\n\nSimilarly, fingerprint detection and face feature detection can be done swiftly and with lesser doubts using AI tools. Due to the accuracy of AI tools, it is assumed that Artificial Intelligence will replace many engineers and specialists in the future.\n\nThough the scope of AI seems to be quite promising in the high-tech industry, there are some obstacles to adopting AI.\n\nAll AI-based projects require a lot of time and investment. Industries and organizations need special hardware and software tools for executing the AI model. Furthermore, training the model is itself a very time-consuming and costly procedure.\n\nSince AI experiments' success rate is not promising, many investors are reluctant to invest their resources in such projects. Thus, the limitation of investment in high-risk AI projects is one of the major obstacles in adopting it in the high-tech industry.\n\nBuilding AI-based hardware and training AI models is a very time taking and tedious process. It yields results at a slower pace.\n\nKeeping in mind the faster pace of the high-tech industry, most AI machines and models become outdated even before their actual execution. This time-lapse between the idea and its execution is a hindrance in the way of developing AI.\n\nAI tools and software are dependent on the data feed to them. They can only process and evaluate the data that is there in the system. Anything beyond the scope of existing information is beyond the capacity of AI tools as well. Moreover, it cannot detect errors in the data fed to it.\n\nTherefore, any human error in feeding data can result in the failure of the whole AI model. Therefore, this data dependence is another major obstacle in its adoption in the high-tech industry.\n\nHigh tech industry demands quick and efficient decision-making. Unfortunately, though AI tools can make fast and efficient judgments in many situations, they lack creativity.\n\nNo AI tools, to date, can take abstract decisions based on the scenarios like a human mind can do. No doubt AI tools are versatile, yet they are far behind the creative capacity of the human brain.\n\nArtificial Intelligence seems to have a good scope in the high-tech industry, especially in the telecommunication and computing fields. But it still has a long way to go before being adopted in the biotechnical and engineering fields.\n\nAI is a high-risk investment. And reluctance in adopting AI is a significant barrier in the way of its development and progress.",

                "body": "This year's worldwide electronic waste will be a mountain of an estimated 57.4 million tonnes, a report by Global E-waste Monitor released on World E-Waste Day indicates.\n\nThe waste, which is said to be heavier than the weight of the Great Wall of China, Earth's heaviest artificial object, has seen rapid accumulation over the Covid-19 pandemic period as people dumped obsolete devices and purchased new ones as the new normal pushed them to work from home.\n\nGlobal E-waste Monitor's data shows that an estimated 53.6 million metric tons electronic waste was generated in 2019, representing a 21 per cent jump in the five years since 2014.\n\nWhat now concerns e-waste experts is the prediction that global e-waste will hit 74 million metric tonnes by 2030 as technological obsolescence coerces people to fill up landfills with waste.\n\nThe report further reveals that global e-waste generation is growing annually by 2 metric tonnes, or about 4 per cent, a problem attributed to higher consumption rates of electronics with shorter product lifecycles and limited repair options.\n\nAn emerging viewpoint of the e-waste issue is the ever rising world demand for data and digital services with the European Commission ICT Impact survey disclosing that \"video on demand, movies, social media clips and game streaming take up close to 85 per cent of the bandwidth of data centres.\"\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), internet users have doubled since 2010, traffic has grown approximately 30 per cent annually, and by 2023 internet users worldwide will hit 5.3 billion or 66 per cent of the world's population.\n\nMobile internet users are projected to increase from 3.8 billion in 2019 to 5 billion by 2025 while IoT-connected devices will double from 12 billion to 25 billion in the same period.\n\nThe expanding uses of cloud computing, 5G, Internet of Things, self-driving cars, blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, fintech, e-health and edtech will require an even higher number of servers in data centres.\n\nSpeaking during World E-waste Day on October 14, managing director of Nairobi based Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Centre Mr Boniface Mbithi called on world governments to show more commitment towards controlling the menace.\n\n\"It is not only an environmental problem but also a health issue. Most of the e-waste is handled improperly. We need to do more,\" he told Nation.Africa.\n\nAround the world, experts have called on households, businesses and governments to get behind efforts to get more dead or unused plug-in or battery-operated products to facilities where they can be either repaired or recycled.\n\nAccording to estimates in Europe, where the problem is best studied, 11 of 72 electronic items in an average household are no longer in use or are broken.\n\nAnnually another 4 to 5 kg of unused electrical and electronic products per citizen are hoarded in Europe prior to being discarded.\n\nWhen it comes to mobile phones, a French study estimates that 54 to 113 million mobile phones alone, weighing 10 to 20 tonnes, are sleeping in drawers and other storage spaces in French homes.\n\nIn the US, while many mobile phones are recycled, an estimated 151 million or more phones a year or approximately 416,000 a day are trashed and end up incinerated or landfilled, and that 40 per cent of heavy metals in US landfills come from discarded electronics.\n\nBy weight, discarded big appliances such as stoves and refrigerators constitute the largest component of e-waste.\n\nThese large appliances contain steel, copper and aluminium which makes them attractive to thieves. Despite concerted efforts by governments at many levels, this problem persists.\n\nEven in the EU, which has had comprehensive Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation in place for nearly two decades, consisting of targets and legal responsibilities, the EU's formal e-waste collection rate is only 55 per cent.\n\nThough progress has been made in the last 20 years, states still struggle to achieve the targets for many complex reasons, as documented by the Brussels-based WEEE Forum in a study report.\n\nPascal Leroy, director general of the WEEE Forum, the organisation behind International E-Waste Day said that many factors play a role in making the electrical and electronics sector resource efficient and circular.\n\n\"For example, our member producer responsibility organisations collected and secured responsible recycling of 2.8 per cent of e-waste in 2020. But one thing stands out: as long as citizens don't return their used, broken gear, sell it, or donate it, we will need to continue mining all-new materials causing great environmental damage,\" he said.\n\nThe WEEE Forum estimates that between 40 -50 per cent of e-waste is recycled, but only 17.4 per cent of that is properly treated and recycled.\n\nIn the case of cell phones, tablets, computers and other small information technology products, many factors are thought to discourage recycling, including data security, product value, difficult-to-reach return points, and uncertainty about appropriate recycling, among others.\n\nRuediger Kuehr, director of the Scycle Programme and head of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) Office in Bonn says that a tonne of discarded mobile phones is more valuable than a tonne of gold ore.\n\n\"Embedded in 1 million cell phones, for example, are 24 kilos of gold, 16,000 kilos of copper, 350 kilos of silver, and 14 kilos of palladium, resources that could be recovered and returned to the production cycle. And if we fail to recycle these materials, new supplies need to be mined, harming the environment,\" he warned.\n\nHigh-value, recoverable materials conservatively valued at Sh6 trillion - a sum greater than the Gross Domestic Product of most countries - were mostly dumped or burned in those parts of the world without extended producer responsibility legislation rather than being collected for treatment and reuse.\n\nAhead of the Glasgow COP26 that will kick off at the end of this month, where world governments will discuss global action to reduce carbon emissions, it has been estimated that every tonne of WEEE recycled avoids around 2 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\"Moreover, the recovery of gold and other material from waste saves a lot of carbon dioxide emissions when compared with virgin metal mining,\" says Kees Baldé, senior programme officer of the UN University's Scycle Programme.\n\nEU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Virginijus Sinkevičius says that to change the trend, governments should not think of it as waste, but rather wasted opportunity as longer-lasting products would be massive savings not just for consumers, but in precious raw materials and carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nHe said the commission is working on new eco-design requirements for electronic devices, to increase durability and make them easier to repair.\n\nBut successfully raising collection rates will require every actor to be involved in awareness, including consumers.\n\n\"Alongside convenience, financial compensation, care for the environment, culture and social norms, awareness is one of the key motivators for people to take action on e-waste,\" says Magdalena Charytanowicz of the WEEE Forum in charge of International E-Waste Day.",

                "body": "Washington [US], October 15 (ANI): Hollywood actor-filmmaker George Clooney and Grant Heslov have joined Austrian director Friedrich Moser's feature documentary 'How to Build a Truth Engine' as executive producers through their Smokehouse Pictures banner.\n\nAccording to Variety, the documentary, now in the final stages of filming, tackles investigative journalism and the fight against fake news. Moser follows award-winning journalists from the New York Times, the Associated Press, the ICIJ, and Austria's weeklies Falter and Profil, in their efforts to uncover corruption, disinformation, and war crimes.\n\nProduced by Robert Rippberger and Amina Bayou, it tracks teams who are developing artificial intelligence software for real-time detection of conspiracy theories, fake news and disinformation.\n\nA former TV journalist, Moser founded Vienna-based Blue Plus Green Communication production company in 2001. He last directed 'Money Bots', released last year, writing and directing the documentary 'Beer! A Love Story' in 2019.\n\nOther documentaries include 'A Good American', a film about Bill Binney and the NSA that premiered in 2015 at the Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival before going on to receive multiple nominations on the documentary fest circuit. He has been writing, directing, shooting and producing documentaries since 1999.\n\n\"George has always been a fierce defender of journalism and he personally helped get evidence related to war crimes in Sudan out to the public through his Satellite Sentinel Project,\" Moser said.\n\nHe added, \"His desire to use his global platform to help ring the alarm about the irreparable harm to our society and the efforts to curb information warfare makes him an immeasurable addition to this project. I couldn't be more excited about teaming up with George, Grant and Smokehouse for furthering this critically important conversation.\"As per Variety, 'How to Build a Truth Engine' is also being produced by Moser, SIE Films, the Front Corner, and Blue Plus Green Communication.

                "body": "First of all, we must clarify that this article is not a tutorial about how to increase the clock speed or overclock a specific CPU or GPU model, but we are going to explain how, through artificial intelligence algorithms, more processors Advanced are capable of dynamically adjusting the clock speed to the thermal and consumption situation of our PCs.\n\nLet's not forget that even if we talk about a form factor as widely used as a laptop, each model, and even within the same brand, has its own thermal, energy consumption and ventilation specifications.\n\nTherefore, contrary to what happens with exclusive designs, such as a video game console, in the design of the different hardware components in PC, especially the CPU and GPU, they have to create mechanisms that allow the hardware to adjust a series of parameters automatically according to the thermal or consumption information at all times.\n\nOne of the peculiarities of artificial intelligence is its ability to make predictions through the data obtained at all times and we will have heard in the middle of the marketing of some other company of an advanced overclocking system based on AI that allows to adjust a lot the better the clock speed of a specific processor or graphics card. Well then, let's demystify these pieces of hardware.\n\nWhen we talk about artificial intelligence we are not talking about machines that are self-aware of themselves or of their own thinking, but about a combination of hardware and software that is used mainly for two types of tasks mainly:\n\nStarting with the data classification, this is understood in that by labeling a set of information we teach the system to identify information and with it it can categorize it. How does this help with overclocking? Well, it is simple, each instruction of the CPU has a specific energy cost, in such a way that when it is executed the overclocking system can take notes and collect information about the consumption of each one of them. What is achieved with it? Well, that we can execute as many instructions as possible at the highest speed that allows a constant consumption of the processor, which translates into being able to accelerate the execution of the programs more efficiently.\n\nAs for the other aspect, that of prediction, we must remember first of all what a mathematical function is, which in a simplified way is defined as the relationship between at least two functions that are dependent on each other where the dependency is done in the form of a mathematical formula. Do not be alarmed, our goal is not to do an algebra class, but if your memory fails you we can reduce the explanation that a function is a mathematical equation where one half defines the value of the other half.\n\nFor example, suppose our function is X So if we give values to the unknown and draw them on a graph, it would end up making a parabola like the one in the image that you have just above these lines, this allows us to make a prediction towards where the function will mathematically evolve.\n\nWell, artificial intelligence prediction systems work the other way around. So they do not start with a formula and from there they take a set of data, but the path is the other way around and what they do is collect a large amount of information to create a prediction, which is a formula that they will derive of it. When this formula is applied, it is compared with the original data to see if the resulting data is the same. And what happens if the AI is wrong? He simply performs a movement called backtraking that allows him to polish the resulting formula.\n\nEvery machine learning system requires large amounts to work and while traditional overclocking systems use a series of internal tables in common with all models of a processor that indicates the relationships between clock speeds, temperatures, consumption and time in the that can be together as reference elements, the artificial intelligence-based overclock instead get their data on time of operation. The reason for this is very simple, for reasons that are beyond the control of the manufacturer in the creation of a new wafer, not all chips come out the same in it.\n\nOne way to get the thermal and consumption information is the use of electromechanical components that make advanced telemetry systems in key parts of the circuitry and give the information in real time. This allows the overclocking system to collect data that will use it to infer a power consumption formula that allows the system to have a stable overclock system. Obviously, since this system is based on AI, it has to have a supervision system, which acts as a security system that will automatically adjust the voltages and clock speed when critical speeds are reached.\n\nLittle by little, the AI overclock system will polish the resulting mathematical function, allowing a more energy efficient clock speed adjustment while allowing it to last longer.\n\nNo, we do not believe that overclocking through artificial intelligence will make the traditional one disappear, mainly due to the fact that we see it as a complementary element that will make it safer to increase the speed of both our CPUs and our GPUs. In addition, overclocking is a rising value among hardware enthusiasts and there are users always willing to pay more to be able to fiddle with their hardware, if in addition the manufacturers give them a totally safe environment where the system adapts to the chosen cooling system. by the user as then the levels of customization and modding can reach new levels.\n\nThese new intelligent overclocking systems more advanced than the previous ones also allow not only a part of the system to adjust to consumption, but the whole system can do it in unison.",

Neeraja Patil, 17, from Mumbai stood first among girl candidates in the state with an AIR of 266.\n\nBoth Nair, student of Kandivali-based Ryan International School (CBSE board) and Patil, student of Dixit Road Junior College of Science at Vile Parle, plan to pursue computer science at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. A total of 141,699 candidates appeared in both papers 1 and 2 this year, of which around 41,862 candidates have qualified.\n\nThis year, the eligibility and admission guidelines were tweaked owing to the pandemic. As against an aspirant having to score 75% or more in Class 12 board exams to be eligible for JEE-Adv, the criterion was tweaked, considering all school education boards in the country scrapped Class 12 exams this year.\n\nCandidates should have cleared their class 12 exams and should be among the top 2.5 lakh successful candidates including all categories in JEE-Mains 2021. The number of spare seats in various programs will be decided by individual IITs ensuring that every institute has at least 20% female enrollment in undergraduate programmes.\n\nNair aspires to pursue research in artificial intelligence. He likes listening to music and playing football. He has been preparing for JEE for the past two years. \"I enjoy studying, constantly solving assignments and focusing on a lot of practice. I studied only during the day and at night would focus on sleep and relaxing my mind and body. The most important thing was to eat healthy and use gadgets only for academics. Sometimes I would watch informative videos on music and football,\" said Nair, who resides in Kandivli. Nair, whose father is an IT consultant and mother a computer science professor, is the only child.\n\nSimilarly, Santacruz resident Patil has always been academically inclined. She started training for JEE from Class 9 onwards. Last year, she received a rank of 400 in JEE mains. \"It has been a great leap for me in terms of my overall rank. I strictly followed my study timetable and ensured that I practised to the core. Every morning I indulged in yoga which calmed my mind,\" added Patil, whose father works for Tata Power (Solar) and mother is employed with Mahagenco.\n\n\"The online classes this year did not deter my spirit.

The project is based in Lancaster.\n\nJaleel Gray, 18, graduated in the spring from Antelope Valley High School. He attends community college but signed up for the paid AI program because he wanted to get paid to learn something new.\n\n\"AI is being used a lot more in the world. You see AI in phones and everything so I feel it's very important to learn about AI,\" Gray said.\n\nProject Joy's founder Kim Watson and her team launched the 12-month pilot program in January at a community center. The LA County Department of Mental Health, California Community Foundation and other donors fund the program.\n\nWatson said the goal is to grow talent for the tech companies in the Antelope Valley.\n\n\"We have tech all around us from Lockheed to Boeing to Northrup, Edwards Air Force base. However, a lot of our youth, especially Black youth and youth of color, don't feel connected to those opportunities,\" Watson said. \"So we're intentional about giving our youth the skillsets, the connections, the confidence to enter the field that's right here in our backyard.\"\n\nStudents hear from guest speakers with companies like Lockheed Martin.\n\n\"We are proud that our employees have connected with Project Joy to encourage and shine the light on the incredible talents in our underrepresented communities...Some of those employees were mentored by a Lockheed Martin engineer in their own classrooms....Representation is key,\" the Palmdale-based company said in a statement.\n\nProject Joy also has a media production program and helps youth with job skills like creating resumes and cover letters.\n\n\"My resume was terrible. I didn't know much about how to make a cover letter. The all-around skills they teach you about interviewing resume building, it's amazing,\" Gray said.\n\nHe said he is considering becoming a research analyst at a tech company after playing college football.\n\nProject Joy is working to make the pilot program permanent by having it be available at all local high schools.",

                "body": "WINTER HAVEN, FL / ACCESSWIRE / October 15, 2021 / William Carson believes that the contracting field has plenty of room to grow and expand and become even more fascinatingly complex and intriguing in 2022. Technological innovations come along every year that helps to improve this market and make it easier, more efficient, and cost-effective. Here are a few of the most promising potential changes that he believes will impact 2022 and beyond and reasons why they will matter to builders like you.\n\nPotential Innovations William Carson Believes Will Change Contracting\n\nEvery year, contractors learn more about various unique changes in their field that help to cut back on needless labor and improve their design capabilities. Of these, William Carson believes that additive manufacturing and construction will be one of the leading choices in 2022. This unique process allows you to adjust designs and add new elements and remove them, producing a fascinating array of different choices for builders and designers.\n\nHe also expects that artificial intelligence will help with this process and construction in general. This type of AI has become more advanced in recent years and is likely to become even more prominent as time passes. Artificial intelligence of this kind could be used to produce reasonably advanced and innovative architectural design ideas in a fraction of the normal time it usually takes. Many experts anticipate that AI-assisted design will take over the more mundane elements of contracting, allowing builders to be free for more creative work.\n\nBeyond these concepts, William Carson also expects things like building information modeling, cyber-physical systems, and enhanced environmental protection may also become more common and widespread. These technological advances focus on producing more detailed and advanced design models, including enhanced protection and higher safety for many elements of the construction world.\n\nFor example, various types of green building materials will likely help to make the planet a healthier and safer place to live. These include recycled concrete and asphalt, improved artificial wood designs, stronger insulation, more shock-proof materials for earthquake-prone areas, and much more. Such innovations should help to produce an overall safer and more reliable construction environment.\n\nLikewise, William Carson anticipates things like smart technology and machine automation will continue improving construction. For instance, an automated drilling system could sync to a tablet or phone via Bluetooth and allow builders and contractors to produce accurate and high-quality construction parts automatically. In this way, they could cut back on mistakes and focus on more critical creative tasks.\n\nSuch steps aren't designed to take away the human initiative or replace labor but to enhance it. For example, rather than spending hours preparing and cutting materials, contractors can focus on assembling them creatively and producing fantastic design elements. Speeding up this process would also help to improve their turnaround time and make it easier to take on more frequent and extensive job opportunities.\n\nCONTACT:\n\nCaroline HunterWeb Presence, LLC+17868470699\n\nSOURCE: William Carson",

Although the piece is not and should not be construed as editorial content, the sponsored content team works to ensure that any and all information contained within is true and accurate to the best of their knowledge and research. The content that follows is for informational purposes only and not intended to be investing advice.\n\nNeil Fernandes is founder of Enroute AI. Fernandes studied operations research during a graduate program in industrial engineering at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. During that time, he became interested in developing algorithms for transportation, which eventually led him to founding San Francisco, California-based Enroute AI. The company, which employs 10 people, powers approximately 50,000 deliveries every month and is releasing new features nearly every week.\n\nFernandes agreed to answer questions from Modern Shipper on Enroute AI and the last-mile routing segment. (Answers have been edited for style and brevity)\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Tell me a little about Enroute AI.\n\nFERNANDES. Enroute AI is a SaaS solution for simplifying last-mile logistics. At the core of our offering is a dynamic route optimization engine that uses AI to plan delivery routes that get even better with time. We provide our clients with a cloud-based dashboard for routing, real-time tracking, and dispatching. Enroute AI also includes intuitive iOS and Android apps for delivery drivers, proactive delivery notifications to end customers, and a robust API service for various integrations.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. How did the idea for Enroute AI come about?\n\nFERNANDES. The idea for Enroute came about when I was working as an analyst at a supply chain consulting firm run by an MIT professor. From the various projects that I had done, I realized that most companies were struggling with their last-mile operations, including the Fortune 500s who had access to state-of-the-art routing software. The software would plan routes that were not achieving the desired results in the real world. Almost none of the deliveries ended up being on time. The routes were being planned without considering traffic conditions, or the actual time it takes to make a delivery.\n\nWhile developing Enroute AI, I knew it had to be super easy to use and intuitive. I didn't want our customers to have to go through long implementation cycles, or significant training. In developing the product, I sat with dispatchers and rode on delivery trucks for months to see what exactly was causing delays and how we could build something that a driver and dispatcher could easily use.\n\nAs I started working with small and medium businesses, I realized that their struggles with last-mile deliveries were even worse than the bigger companies.\n\nA look at one of the screen's in Enroute AI's system. (Photo: Enroute AI)\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Can you tell me a little about Enroute AI's approach to last-mile logistics?\n\nFERNANDES. Our philosophy while planning delivery routes is to make them very close to reality. Our ultimate goal is to be able to plan routes such that our predicted ETAs for stops on the route are within a couple of minutes of the actual delivery. This means that we have to predict traffic better, understand infrastructure limitations like one-way streets and road closures, and allow room for last-minute surprises. We also have to be really good at estimating how long it actually takes to complete the delivery once the driver gets to the drop-off location. For example, a delivery to the front porch of a house in the suburbs might take a minute or two. However, a delivery to the 43rd floor at 500 Wall Street is going to take much longer.\n\nWe strongly believe that software should be easy and intuitive to use. Most last-mile software has a long implementation time and a steep learning curve. It's not built for drivers and dispatchers who are usually not technically savvy. Most last-mile software is built by software engineers with little to no real-world logistics background. However, we understand the nuances of the delivery workflow. We designed Enroute AI to be intuitive, easy to use, and to automate as many tasks for the drivers as possible.\n\nFinally, we built EnrouteAI to be dynamic and flexible. Exceptions happen every day in the last-mile world. We make it easy for dispatchers and drivers to respond to last-minute customer requests or disruptions in the schedule. This dynamic route optimization capability is a key differentiator for us.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. You've spoken with end customers, delivery drivers and supply chain professionals, what are their biggest pain points with current technology?\n\nFERNANDES. Each of these parties has specific pain points with current routing technology.Customers don't like it when they have to take time off work to receive a delivery and they are unsure of when it will actually arrive. Almost everyone we talked to prefers a late delivery with good visibility to an uninformed delivery where they are kept in the dark.\n\nI did not fully appreciate how hard a delivery driver's job is until I started riding along with them on delivery routes. They have to worry about a ton of things simultaneously: traffic, parking, finding the exact entrance to the building, knowing where to leave the package once they are inside the building etc. Their biggest pain point was that their existing routing technology was static and not responsive to real-world conditions leading them into areas of high traffic, going down roads that are closed to traffic, or asking them to make unsafe turns on busy roads. Other frustrating things for them were that it would route them to the leasing office of an apartment complex instead of the actual apartment, or the reception of an office building instead of the loading dock, which in rush hour downtown traffic could cost the driver half an hour. Also, most routing apps only work when a driver is connected to the internet. Their routing app stops working when they are downtown, inside high rises, basements, or in remote locations.\n\nShippers who operate their own fleet have trouble understanding the true cost of a delivery. Their routing software is not able to give them an estimate of how much a particular stop on the route costs them, which results in them losing money on some stops. One of our customers uses our software to decide which stops should be offloaded to a third-party carrier since we provide visibility into per stop costs.\n\nAnother pain point for our clients is visibility and billing issues when dealing with 3rd party carriers. Many of our clients use a mix of internal and external fleets for their deliveries. This combination helps them scale and expand to new geographies. However, their route planning software does not give them visibility into external carrier's deliveries. This lack of visibility costs them valuable customer support time when customers call support asking for ETAs. It also results in them overpaying their carrier for all the missed and late deliveries. We integrate with many carriers to solve the visibility issue.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Technology providers are always trying to solve for all possible conditions, but even the most robust and intelligent solutions run into real-world challenges. How has the Enroute AI technology been adapted to meet these ever-changing needs?\n\nFERNANDES. We realized pretty quickly that each customer's way of running their business is different. We did not want to be stuck with a platform that needs to be re-architected for each new customer or vertical market. Also, from a software perspective, things can get messy when maintaining multiple codebases for different customers. What we settled on is building a core that is common to all customers. Things like validating and geocoding addresses, optimizing the sequence of stops, notifications etc. Everything else is built as plugins (adaptors). This enables us to cater to each customer's unique needs.\n\nWe also know that software and AI can only get you 90% there, it can't account for every single eventuality that may happen when making pickups and deliveries. We try to mitigate some of that by making it very easy to modify routes by dragging and dropping markers on a map, to move stops between vehicles, automating notifications to the customers etc. All along our AI is learning and planning better routes with each delivery.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. You've mentioned that Enroute AI's artificial intelligence is able to capture small details such as which driveway is best to use when entering a location. How are you able to collect this type of granular data?\n\nFERNANDES. Yes, we gather and process a lot of data that captures the nuances of making a delivery. We call that our \"fingerprint of the city.\" We noticed that a driver who is familiar with a delivery location can complete a delivery in the fraction of time it takes a new driver. This is because the experienced driver knows the best place to park, which building entrance to take, and where specifically the package needs to be dropped off. None of the routing software I'm aware of captures this information. Making location insights available to drivers is a key factor in ensuring deliveries happen on time. For example, we work with a company making deliveries in Manhattan. They were using a routing solution that sent the driver to the Google address of the building which happens to be the front desk, instead of the loading dock. With one-way streets and rush-hour traffic, this can cause delays of up to half an hour.\n\nWe use multiple providers for location data; however, our biggest source of data is our mobile app for drivers. We constantly collect GPS pings from our mobile app for drivers and use machine learning to recognize patterns from that information. We are able to learn where the driver usually parks, what the traffic patterns look like in the neighborhood, where the exact entrance of the building is, etc. We are also experimenting with collecting WiFi and Bluetooth network information to improve location accuracy within buildings and dense urban environments where only relying on the GPS can sometimes show your location as being a block away.\n\nData is only half of the story; our secret sauce lies in processing this information to make sense out of it. If you only look at raw GPS pings in downtown for example, you might think that your driver is driving through buildings and flying across blocks. We need to filter out those outlier data points and only rely on points that make sense. When you deal with AI algorithms, garbage in equals garbage out. We spend a lot of effort making sure we feed our algorithms the right data.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Last-mile drivers face any number of obstacles each day - traffic congestion, missed delivery windows, weather, etc. What approach does Enroute AI take with its solution to minimize disruptions due to real world, often unforeseen situations to ensure deliveries are made on time and drivers and vehicles remain efficient?\n\nFERNANDES. You're right, last-mile delivery is a hard job. As a delivery driver you deal with multiple unforeseen obstacles every single day. I still regularly ride along with delivery drivers during their daily routes. Every time they find something hard to do, I start thinking of ways that we can simplify the job for them.\n\nHere are a few things we do to minimize disruptions and make it easier on delivery drivers:\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Last-mile delivery efficiency starts long before a package is loaded into a vehicle and requires coordination across a number of different departments and businesses. What obstacles exist to the integration of these disparate systems?\n\nFERNANDES. Yes, from the outside it's not apparent how many things have to come together to make an on-time delivery possible. It looks and sounds simple until you start to understand all of the systems (ordering, billing, etc.) involved. It's a very daunting and complex problem. There needs to be integration with many systems to ensure efficient delivery. For example, we had to build an integration with a furniture company's e-commerce ordering system to make sure they were not promising customers delivery on days when they had no capacity.\n\nThis problem also extends downstream into the billing systems as well. Making sure that payments are made according to the contract is pretty daunting: fuel surcharges, waiting times, the premium for white-glove services, etc. Billing was such a big pain point for our clients that we started integrating our software into their billing system to process rules on the rate card automatically (time, distance, number of packages, fuel surcharge, etc.).\n\nThe biggest problem we face is that many carriers and shippers run on legacy platforms that have an integration layer (they don't support API integration). Getting data in and out of these systems involves a convoluted process of exporting data from their system and importing them into our system. This process often requires manual intervention and can be error prone. We also encounter clients who use TMSs and order management systems that support integrations, but these systems lock down that functionality to thwart competition.\n\nWhat makes integration even more confusing, is that we deal with carriers and shippers using different terminology for the same process, depending on their industry. Even within the same industry carriers and shippers use different terminology. For example, some shippers refer to white glove service as premium service, whereas some carriers refer to it as special deliveries. As a result, we can't build a one size fits all integration. We need to customize the integration depending on the shipper and carrier combination, which can be pretty daunting.\n\nOur approach to deal with complexity of integration is by architecting our software to be flexible and extensible. As mentioned earlier we have core functionality that is common to all our clients. All the customizations and one-off integrations are built as plugins (adaptors). When we notice that the plugin is used by enough people, we integrate that into our core functionality.",

                "title": "Researchers show Facebook's ad tools can target a single user",
                "body": "A new research paper written by a team of academics and computer scientists from Spain and Austria has demonstrated that it's possible to use Facebook's targeting tools to deliver an ad exclusively to a single individual if you know enough about the interests Facebook's platform assigns them.\n\nThe paper -- entitled Unique on Facebook: Formulation and Evidence of (Nano)targeting Individual Users with non-PII Data -- describes a \"data-driven model\" that defines a metric showing the probability a Facebook user can be uniquely identified based on interests attached to them by the ad platform.\n\nThe researchers demonstrate that they were able to use Facebook's Custom Audience tool to target a number of ads in such a way that each ad only reached a single, intended Facebook user.\n\nThe research raises fresh questions about potentially harmful uses of Facebook's ad targeting tools, and -- more broadly -- questions about the legality of the tech giant's personal data processing empire given that the information it collects on people can be used to uniquely identify individuals, picking them out of the crowd of others on its platform even purely based on their interests.\n\nThe findings could increase pressure on lawmakers to ban or phase out behavioral advertising -- which has been under attack for years, over concerns it poses a smorgasbord of individual and societal harms. And, at the least, the paper seems likely to drive calls for robust checks and balances on how such invasive tools can be used.\n\nThe findings also underscore the importance of independent research being able to interrogate algorithmic adtech -- and should increase pressure on platforms not to close down researchers' access.\n\n\"The results from our model reveal that the 4 rarest interests or 22 random interests from the interests set FB [Facebook] assigns to a user make them unique on FB with a 90% probability,\" write the researchers from Madrid's University Carlos III, the Graz University of Technology in Austria and the Spanish IT company, GTD System & Software Engineering, detailing one key finding -- that having a rare interest or lots of interests that Facebook knows about can make you easily identifiable on its platform, even among a sea of billions of other users.\n\n\"In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that addresses individuals' uniqueness considering a user base at the worldwide population's order of magnitude,\" they go on, referring to the scale inherent in Facebook's data mining of its 2.8BN+ active users (NB: the company also processes information about non-users, meaning its reach scales to even more Internet users than are active on Facebook).\n\nThe researchers suggest the paper presents the first evidence of \"the possibility of systematically exploiting the FB advertising platform to implement nanotargeting based on non-PII [interest-based] data\".\n\nThere have been earlier controversies over Facebook's ad platform being a conduit for one-to-one manipulative -- such as this 2019 Daily Dot article about a company called the Spinner which was selling a 'service' to sex-frustrated husbands to target psychologically manipulative messages at their wives and girlfriends. The suggestive, subliminally manipulative ads would pop up on the targets' Facebook and Instagram feeds.\n\nThe research paper also references an incident in UK political life, back in 2017, when Labour Party campaign chiefs apparently successfully used Facebook's Custom Audience ad-targeting tool to 'pull the wool' over former leader Jeremy Corbyn's eyes. But in that case the targeting was not just at Corbyn; it also reached his associates, and a few aligned journalists.\n\nWith this research the team demonstrates it's possible to use Facebook's Custom Audience tool to target ads at just one Facebook user -- a process they're referring to as \"nanotargeting\" (vs the current adtech 'standard' of microtargeting 'interest-based' advertising at groups of users).\n\n\"We run an experiment through 21 Facebook ad campaigns that target three of the authors of this paper to prove that, if an advertiser knows enough interests from a user, the Facebook Advertising Platform can be systematically exploited to deliver ads exclusively to a specific user,\" they write, adding that the paper provides \"the first empirical evidence\" that one-to-one/nanotargeting can be \"systematically implemented on FB by just knowing a random set of interests of the targeted user\".\n\nThe interest data they used for their analysis was collected from 2,390 Facebook users via a browser extension they created that the users had installed before January 2017.\n\nThe extension, called Data Valuation Tool for Facebook Users, parsed each user's Facebook ad preferences page to gather the interests assigned to them, as well as providing a real-time estimate about the revenue they generate for Facebook based on the ads they receive while browsing the platform.\n\nWhile the interest data was gathered before 2017, the researchers' experiments testing whether one-to-one targeting is possible through Facebook's ad platform took place last year.\n\n\"In particular, we have configured nanotargeting ad campaigns targeting three authors of this paper,\" they explain, discussing the results of their tests. \"We tested the results of our data-driven model by creating tailored audiences for each targeted author using combinations of 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 20, and 22 randomly selected interests from the list of interests FB had assigned them.\n\n\"In total, we ran 21 ad campaigns between October and November 2020 to demonstrate that nanotargeting is feasible today. Our experiment validates the results of our model, showing that if an attacker knows 18+ random interests from a user, they will be able to nanotarget them with a very high probability. In particular, 8 out of the 9 ad campaigns that used 18+ interests in our experiment successfully nanotargeted the chosen user.\"\n\nSo having 18 or more Facebook interests just got really interesting to anyone who wants to manipulate you.\n\nOne way to prevent one-to-one targeting would be if Facebook were to put a robust a limit on the minimum audience size.\n\nPer the paper, the adtech giant provides a \"Potential Reach\" value to advertisers using its Ads Campaign Manager tool if the potential audience size for a campaign is greater than 1,000 (or greater than 20, prior to 2018 when Facebook increased the limit).\n\nHowever the researchers found that Facebook does not actually prevent advertisers running a campaign targeting fewer users than those potential reach limits -- the platform just does not tell advertisers how many (or, well, few) people their messaging will reach.\n\nThey were able to demonstrate this by running multiple campaigns that successfully targeted a single Facebook user -- validating that the audience size for their ads was one by looking at data generated by Facebook's ad reporting tools (\"FB reported that only one user had been reached\"); having a log record in their web server generated by the (sole) user click on the ad; and -- in a third validation step -- they asked each nanotargeted user to collect a snapshot of the ad and its associated \"Why am I seeing this ad?\" option. Which they say matched their targeting parameters in the successfully nanotargeted cases.\n\n\"The main conclusions derived from our experiment are the following: (i) nanotargeting a user on FB is highly likely if an attacker can infer 18+ interests from the targeted user; (ii) nanotargeting is extremely cheap, and (iii) based on our experiments, 2/3 of the nanotargeted ads are expected to be delivered to the targeted user in less than 7 effective campaign hours,\" they add in a summary of the results.\n\nIn another section of the paper discussing countermeasures to prevent nanotargeting, the researchers argue that Facebook's claimed limits on audience size \"have been proven to be completely ineffective\" -- and assert that the tech giant's limit of 20 is \"not currently being applied\".\n\nThey also suggest there are workarounds for the limit of 100 that Facebook claims it applies to Custom Audiences (another targeting tool that involves advertisers uploading PII).\n\nFrom the paper:\n\nWhile the researchers refer throughout their paper to interest-based data as \"non-PII\" [aka, personally identifiable information] it is important to note that that framing is meaningless in a European legal context -- where the law, under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes a much broader view of personal data.\n\nPII is a more common term in the US -- which does not have comprehensive (federal) privacy legislation equivalent to the pan-EU GDPR.\n\nAdtech companies also typically prefer to refer to PII, given it's far more bounded a category vs all the information they actually process which can be used to identify and profile individuals to target them with ads.\n\nUnder the GDPR, personal data does not only include the obvious identifiers, like a person's name or email address (aka 'PII'), but can also encompass information that can be used -- indirectly -- to identify an individual, such as a person's location or indeed their interests.\n\nHere's the relevant chunk from the GDPR (Article 4(1)) [emphasis ours]:\n\nOther research has also repeatedly -- over decades -- shown that re-identification of individuals is possible with, at times, just a handful of pieces of 'non-PII' information, such as credit card metadata or Netflix viewing habits.\n\nSo it should not surprise us that Facebook's vast people profiling, ad targeting empire, which continuously and pervasively mines Internet users' activity for interest-based signals (aka, personal data) to profile individuals for the purpose of targeting them with 'relevant' ads, has created a new attack vector for -- potentially -- manipulating almost anyone in the world if you know enough about them (and they have a Facebook account).\n\nBut that does not mean there are no legal problems here.\n\nIndeed, the legal basis that Facebook claims for processing people's personal data for ad targeting has been under challenge in the EU for years.\n\nThe tech giant used to claim that users consent to their personal data being used for ad targeting. However it does not offer a free, specific and informed choice to people over whether they want to be profiled for behavioral ads or just want to connect with their friends and family. (And free, specific and informed is the GDPR standard for consent.)\n\nIf you want to use Facebook you have to accept your information being used for ad targeting. This is what EU privacy campaigners have dubbed 'forced consent'. Aka, coercion, not consent.\n\nHowever, since the GDPR came into application (back in May 2018), Facebook has -- seemingly -- switched to claiming it's legally able to process Europeans' information for ads because users are actually in a contract with it to receive ads.\n\nA preliminary decision by Facebook's lead EU regulator, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), which was published earlier this week, has proposed to fine the company $36M for not being transparent enough about that silent switch.\n\nAnd while the DPC doesn't seem to have a problem with Facebook's ad contract claim, other European regulators disagree -- and are likely to object to Ireland's draft decision -- so the regulatory scrutiny over that particular Facebook GDPR complaint is ongoing and far from over.\n\nIf the tech giant is ultimately found to be bypassing EU law it could finally be forced to give users a free choice over whether their information can be used for ad targeting -- which would essentially blast an existential hole in its ad targeting empire, since even holding a few pieces of interest data is personal data, as this research underlines.\n\nFor now, though, the tech giant is using its customary tactic of denying there's anything to see here.\n\nIn a statement responding to the research, a Facebook spokesperson dismissed the paper -- claiming it is \"wrong about how our ad system works\".\n\nFacebook's statement goes on to try to divert attention from the researchers' core conclusions in an effort to minimize the significance of their findings -- with its spokesperson writing:\n\nResponding to Facebook's rebuttal, one of the paper's authors -- Angel Cuevas -- described its argument as \"unfortunate\" -- saying the company should be deploying stronger countermeasures to prevent the risk of nanotargeting, rather than trying to claim there is no problem.\n\nIn the paper the researchers identify a number of harmful risks they say could be associated with nanotargeting -- such as psychological persuasion, user manipulation and blackmailing.\n\n\"It is surprising to find that Facebook is implicitly recognizing that nanotargeting is feasible and the only countermeasure is assuming advertisers are unable to infer users interests,\" Cuevas told TechCrunch.\n\n\"There are many ways interests could be inferred by advertisers. We did that in our paper with a browser plug-in (with explicit consent from users for research purposes). Even more, beyond interests there are other parameters (we did not use in our research) such as age, gender, city, zip code, etc.\n\n\"We think this is an unfortunate argument. We believe a player like Facebook can implement stronger countermeasures than assuming advertisers are unable to infer user interests to be later used to define audiences in the Facebook ads platform.\"\n\nOne might recall -- for example -- the 2018 Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal, where a developer that had access to Facebook's platform was able to extract data on millions of users, without most of the users' knowledge or consent -- via a quiz app.\n\nSo, as Cuevas says, it's not hard to envisage similarly opaque and underhand tactics being deployed by advertisers/attackers/agents to harvest Facebook users' interest data to try to manipulate specific individuals.\n\nIn the paper the researchers note that a few days after their nanotargeting experiment had ended Facebook shuttered the account they'd used to run the campaigns -- without explanation.\n\nThe tech giant did not respond to specific questions we put to it about the research, including why it closed the account -- and, if it did so because it had detected the nanotargeting issue, why it failed to prevent the ads running and targeting a single user in the first place.\n\nWhat might the wider implications be for Facebook's business as a result of this research?\n\nOne privacy researcher we spoke to suggested the research will certainly be useful for litigation -- which is growing in Europe, given the slow pace of privacy enforcement by EU regulators against Facebook specifically (and adtech more generally).\n\nAnother pointed out that the findings underline how Facebook has the ability to \"systematically re-identity\" users at scale -- \"while pretending it does not process 'personal data' on the data\" -- suggesting the tech giant has amassed enough data on enough people that it can, essentially, circumvent narrowly bounded legal restrictions that might seek to put limits on its processing of PII.\n\nSo regulators looking to put meaningful limits on harms that can flow from behavioral advertising will need to be wise to how Facebook's own algorithms can seek out and make use of proxies in the masses of data it holds and attaches to users -- and its likely line of associated argument that its processing therefore avoids any legal implications (a tactic Facebook has used on the issue of inferred sensitive interests, for example).\n\nAnother privacy watcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent privacy researcher and consultant, called the research staggering -- describing the paper as among the top ten most important privacy research results of this decade.\n\n\"Reaching 1 user out of 2.8bn? While the Facebook platform claimed there are precautions making such microtargeting impossible? So far, this is among the top 10 most important privacy research results in this decade,\" he told TechCrunch.\n\n\"It seems that users are identifiable by their interests in the meaning of article 4(1) of the GDPR, meaning that interests constitute personal data. The only caveat is that we are not certain how such a processing would scale [given the nanotesting was only tested on three users].\"\n\nOlejnik said the research shows the targeting is based on personal data -- and \"perhaps even special category data in the meaning of GDPR Article 9\".\n\n\"This would mean that the user's explicit consent is needed. Unless of course appropriate protections were made. But based on the paper we conclude that these, if present, are not sufficient,\" he added.\n\nAsked if he believes the research indicates a breach of the GDPR, Olejnik said: \"DPAs should investigate. No question about it,\" adding: \"Even if the matter may be technically challenging, building a case should take two days max.\"\n\nWe flagged the research to Facebook's lead DPA in Europe, the Irish DPC -- asking the privacy regulator whether it would investigate to determine if there had been a breach of the GDPR or not -- but at the time of writing it had not responded.\n\nOn the question of whether the paper strengthens the case for outlawing microtargeting, Olejnik argues that curbing the practice \"is the way forward\"-- but says the question now is how to do that.\n\n\"I don't know if the current industry and political environment would be prepared for a total ban now. We should demand technical precautions, at the very least,\" he said. \"I mean, we were already told that these were in place but it appears this is not the case [in the case of nanotargeting on Facebook].\"\n\nOlejnik also suggested there could be changes coming down the pipe based on some of the ideas built into Google's Privacy Sandbox proposal -- which has, however, been stalled as a result of adtech complaints triggering competition scrutiny.\n\nAsked for his views on a ban on microtargeting, Cuevas told us: \"My personal position here is that we need to understand the tradeoff between privacy risks and economy (jobs, innovation, etc). Our research definitely shows that the adtech industry should understand that just thinking of PII information (email, phone, postal address, etc.) is not enough and they need to implement more strict measures regarding the way audiences can be defined.\n\n\"Saying that, we do not agree that microtargeting -- understood as the capacity of defining an audience with (at least) tens of thousands of users -- should be banned. There is a very important market behind microtargeting that creates many jobs and this is a very innovative sector that does interesting things that are not necessarily bad. Therefore, our position is limiting the potential of microtargeting to guarantee the privacy of the users.\"\n\n\"In the area of privacy we believe the open question that is not solved yet is the consent,\" he also said. \"The research community and the adtech ecosystem have to work (ideally together) to create an efficient solution that obtains the informed consent from users.\"\n\nZooming out, there are more legal requirements looming on the horizon for AI-driven tools in Europe.\n\nIncoming EU legislation for high risk applications of artificial intelligence -- which was proposed earlier this year -- has suggested a total ban on AI systems that deploy \"subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness in order to materially distort a person's behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm\".\n\nSo it's at least interesting to speculate whether Facebook's platform might face a ban under the EU's future AI Regulation -- unless the company puts proper safeguards in place that robustly prevent the risk of its ad tools being used to blackmail or psychologically manipulate individual users.\n\nFor now, though, it's lucrative business as usual for Facebook's eyeball targeting empire.\n\nAsked about plans for future research into the platform, Cuevas said the obvious next piece of work they want to do is to combine interests with other demographic information to see if nanotargeting is \"even easier\".\n\n\"I mean, it is very likely that an advertiser could can combine the age, gender, city (or zip code) of the user with a few interests to nanotarget a user,\" he suggested. \"We would like to understand how many of these parameters you need to combine. Inferring the gender, age, location and few interests from a user may be much easier than inferring few tens of interests.\"\n\nCuevas added that the nanotargeting paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference next month.",

                "title": "Ex-Pentagon Software Chief Warns: China Set To Control World",
                "body": "On Sept. 2, the Pentagon's first Air Force Chief Software Officer, Nicolas Chaillan, resigned in protest from his three-year position, citing a lack of support from the Pentagon and senior Air Force leadership as a factor in his departure. Following his public resignation, a frustrated Chaillan -- who aimed to equip the agencies with the most advanced and secure software available -- has been vocal in spelling out the reasons he left, which center around top leadership's consistent inability to \"walk the walk\" in implementing procedures to keep pace with a threatening China. He remarked:\n\n\"We have no competing fighting chance against China in 15 to 20 years. Right now, it's already a done deal; it is [nearly] over, in my opinion. China is set to dominate the future world, controlling everything from media narratives to geopolitics.\"\n\nIn his insightful resignation letter, Chaillan reveals he tried to raise the alarm of concern three years ago, remarking that \"leadership in the department always says the right things.\" But yet, he routinely saw no change. He warned that the Pentagon is systematically \"setting up critical infrastructure to fail\" on a large scale, as he strived to improve it. Chaillan went on to tell Financial Times that the AI capabilities and cyber defenses of some government departments were at \"kindergarten level.\" Indeed, in recent years multiple U.S. departments have increasingly been subject to hacking attempts and ransomware attacks. The father of three remarked that the failure of the United States to respond to Chinese cyber and other threats is putting his children's future at risk, adding:\n\n\"Right now, the urgency is spending time with my kids first and waking up America before it is too late. Because otherwise, there's just no point. Otherwise, I need to invest in a bunker.\"\n\nChaillan, 37, spent most of his time with the Department of Defense (DoD), working on a Pentagon-wide effort to boost cyber security. He is concerned about the slow pace of technological transformation in the U.S. military. He reminds us that Beijing is heading for global dominance due to its advances in cyber capabilities, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. He cautioned, \"We are running in circles trying to fix transport/connectivity, cloud, endpoints, and various basic IT capabilities that are seen as trivial for any organization outside of the U.S. Government,\" adding:\n\n\"We are the largest software organization on the planet, and we have almost no shared repositories and little to no collaboration across DoD Services. At this point, I am just tired of continuously chasing support and money to do my job. My office still has no billet and no funding, this year and the next.\"\n\nChaillan's concerns are well-founded. China is on a fast track to becoming the leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) superpower by 2030. A National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence report declares the U.S. technology is \"not prepared to defend the United States in the coming artificial intelligence (AI) era.\" Even more concerning, Chaillan, who plans to testify before Congress on the threat posed by China, said it doesn't matter whether the U.S. spends exponentially more than China on defense because that money is being allocated to the wrong areas.\n\nAccording to Chaillan, emerging AI technologies are far more critical to America's future than hardware such as \"big-budget fifth-generation fighter jets\" like the F-35. With China's world dominance a guarantee, he also blamed the reluctance of Google to work with the DoD on AI. In 2018, while working on a software project to improve drone strikes' accuracy, Google quit working with the DoD after twelve employees quit over concerns regarding the ethical use of AI in drone warfare. Meanwhile, Chaillan, who led efforts to install \"zero trust\" architecture at DHS before joining the Pentagon, said Chinese companies are enslaved to work with Beijing as they make massive investments into AI with no regard to ethics. At an Aug. 11 Air Force Association luncheon less than a month before he resigned, Chaillan spoke of his frustrations, stating:\n\n\"I realized pretty quickly, we're very behind in cyber, to a point that it was very scary when it comes to critical infrastructure and the lack of security. And we see it every day, more and more, and I still don't believe we have any kind of handle on what's going on.\"\n\nIn his blistering resignation letter, Chaillan criticized Pentagon \"laggards\" and the lack of funding, declaring that military officials were regularly put in charge of cyber initiatives for which they lacked proper experience. He warned:\n\n\"[W]e are setting up critical infrastructure to fail. We would not put a pilot in the cockpit without extensive flight training; why would we expect someone with no IT experience to be close to successful? While we wasted time in bureaucracy, our adversaries moved further ahead.\"",

                "body": "The company intends to allow people to order one sometime in early 2022.\n\nIndi EV is an electric car startup founded in 2017 and it plans to begin taking orders for its first model, the One, early next year. The vehicle is actually pretty interesting, and aside from all the usual figures about battery pack capacities or range ratings, the One has a few very unique features that other manufacturers are not including in their vehicles.\n\nBut let's talk specs first. The One has a 95 kWh battery pack that the company says is good for a range of 275 miles (442 km). We are not told exactly how much power it makes, but the company claims it can sprint to 60 mph from nought in 5.5 seconds. The targeted MSRP for the vehicle is $45,000 (approx. £32,000), roughly the price of an American market Tesla Model 3, although the launch edition will be better specced (and more expensive), featuring air suspension, 22-inch wheels and other extras.\n\nAndre Hudson, Indi EV Head of Design, explains the thinking behind the vehicle and why they believe it's a different proposition to anything else currently on or on its way to market by saying that\n\nWe at Indi EV saw a disconnect in the software experience when consumers transition from using their computers and phones to getting into their cars. \"Enabled by an electric vehicle platform, we saw an opportunity to bridge this gap and elevate what your vehicle can enable you to do with INDI ONE. We see cars as more than just a mode of transportation, but as a device that empowers the 'you do you' mentality. Through smart design, artificial intelligence, and unparalleled customization features, we're expanding the horizons of how your vehicle can support your life.\n\nSo what are some of the unique features? Well, one is the vehicle's onboard computer called VIC (Vehicle Integrated Computer). The company says that it is actually a 'supercomputer' that can not only play games, but thanks to the array of exterior and interior cameras it can capture footage from your travels or even automatically livestream content.\n\nThe vehicle will also feature what Indi calls the Life Assistant, a virtual assistant, a suite of safety features called Halo ADAS that displays warnings to the driver on the steering wheel. Indi One will be displayed at the company's Beverly Hills showroom on October 14 and 15.",

                "body": "Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile\n\nGoogle is set to launch the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro at an event on 19 October - the first time the Android manufacturer has attempted to compete at the premium level against Apple and Samsung.\n\n\"The product is really, now, The Google Phone,\" Google's hardware chief Rick Osterloh has said, \"so we are ready to invest a lot in marketing and we want to grow.\"\n\nThe phones were officially revealed by Google at the beginning of the month, but numerous details about the devices have leaked ahead of time.\n\nGoogle has officially said that the Pro version of the new Pixel 6 will feature three camera lenses, including a telephoto lens with a four-times optical zoom, while the standard Pixel 6 will only have two lenses - both of which are likely to be a main wide-angle camera and an ultra-wide camera. Rumours suggest the sensors can take in 150 per cent more light compared to those on the Pixel 5.\n\nBoth phones have Google's Tensor chip, is a chip manufactured specifically for the devices to allow artificial intelligence and machine learning to run directly on the phone - powering tools such as Google Translate or Google Lens.\n\nThe tensor chip will also provide greater camera capabilities, as the lenses will snap multiple photos of the same moment and combine them into a single image. This allows the phone, theoretically, to keep details sharp when taking a picture of something in motion, or to adjust a scene to ensure a natural balance between light and shadow.\n\nAs well as the Tensor chip, the phone will have a new Titan M2 chip for improved on-device security after a leaked listing from Carphone Warehouse, and Google will be providing five years of security updates for the device.\n\nSome media were given access to the devices ahead of time by Google, revealing that the Pixel 6 Pro will have a 6.7-inch QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The regular Pixel 6, by contrast, will have a 6.4-inch FHD+ display with a 90Hz refresh rate. Both phones will have under-screen fingerprint scanning, in contrast to the sensor on the back of the device for the Pixel 5.\n\nOther leaks include the battery, which is set to be 4614mAh for the Pixel 6 and 5003mAh for the Pixel 6 Pro - the latter being approximately the same as Samsung's Galaxy S21 device.\n\nThe software for Google's new Pixel devices is well documented, as Android 12 is already available for previous Pixel phones (and Google says that there will be more device-specific updates for the operating system to come).\n\nThe main focus of this iteration is the 'Material You' design, which will update widget and button palettes to match the colours in the phone's background image. Google has also made notifications and the quick-settings functions that appear when users swipe down from the top of the screen more rounded and larger.\n\nWidgets have been a part of Android for a long time, and recently garnered more attention by their addition to Apple's iOS 14 last year, but whether they will be used here remains to be seen. Google's own widgets, such as Calendar or a Memories function for Photos, are either too small to be useful in comparison to having more apps on the home screen, or require extra curation in the case of photos.\n\nThere is a smattering of other changes too: smart home controls are no longer in the power menu but have their own button on the lock screen along with Google Pay, and there are rumours that future updates will bring more features such as better multitasking - but that remains to be seen.\n\nPricing for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro has not yet been revealed for the devices, but in order to compete with premium phones it will likely be around $1000, or £1000. Eventually, Google is set to announce a foldable phone, according to rumours, but knowledge of that device has remained scarce.",

(Nasdaq: GDYN) (\"Grid Dynamics\") company, has partnered with healthtech startup, selfologi, to launch a first of its kind, all-in-one online platform where cosmetic consumers can access trusted information about procedures, explore their local markets and book themselves professional treatments.\n\nAccording to Google search data, more than one million searches are made each month on aesthetic medicine treatments in the Middle East. Meanwhile, selfologi estimates that over $2.2 billion USD worth of cosmetic treatments are taking place across the region annually.\n\n\"Currently, almost all cosmetic treatments are booked offline, with consumers not having access to updated, regionally-relevant information that can aid their decision-making. When it comes to something as personal as cosmetic treatments and procedures, selfologi was born with the vision of offering an unparalleled platform that informs, educates, and helps consumers make the right choice for themselves, and realise their full potential,\" said Tamer Wali, Founder of selfologi.\n\nRob Pye, CEO of selfologi added: \"At selfologi, we aim to revolutionise the cosmetic and healthtech industry by providing a consumer-centric destination for cosmetic treatments and procedures. With support from the region's leading experts in aesthetic technologies, alongside some of the best digital brains in the business, selfologi is set to be a game-changer and a pioneer in the multi-billion-dollar cosmetic treatments industry.\"\n\nThis innovative selfologi business is built on an equally innovative Composable Commerce architecture, providing selfologi the flexibility to deploy best-in-breed technology and bespoke customer experiences crafted to meet the unique needs of their business. Tacit Knowledge and selfologi worked with partners commercetools, Amplience, Algolia to deploy the ecommerce platform, which plans to be fully transactional in the coming months.\n\n\"The composable approach has moved discussions with the business from 'platform A only allows this feature in this particular way' to 'this is how and when we can deliver this feature'. In selfologi's case, this approach allowed them to go to market early with a content rich non-transactional website while the teams continue working to add commerce capabilities as quickly as possible. New features will be available online as soon as they are ready. This is a business-changing, strategic advantage in today's fast changing market,\" said Maneesh Kumar, Director of Technical Consulting and Delivery at Tacit Knowledge.\n\nOn Wednesday October 20, 2021, Grid Dynamics and Tacit Knowledge are hosting a Webinar: Winning with Composable Commerce: Success Story.

(Nasdaq: GDYN) (\"Grid Dynamics\") company, has partnered with healthtech startup, selfologi, to launch a first of its kind, all-in-one online platform where cosmetic consumers can access trusted information about procedures, explore their local markets and book themselves professional treatments.\n\nAccording to Google search data, more than one million searches are made each month on aesthetic medicine treatments in the Middle East. Meanwhile, selfologi estimates that over $2.2 billion USD worth of cosmetic treatments are taking place across the region annually.\n\n\"Currently, almost all cosmetic treatments are booked offline, with consumers not having access to updated, regionally-relevant information that can aid their decision-making. When it comes to something as personal as cosmetic treatments and procedures, selfologi was born with the vision of offering an unparalleled platform that informs, educates, and helps consumers make the right choice for themselves, and realise their full potential,\" said Tamer Wali, Founder of selfologi.\n\nRob Pye, CEO of selfologi added: \"At selfologi, we aim to revolutionise the cosmetic and healthtech industry by providing a consumer-centric destination for cosmetic treatments and procedures. With support from the region's leading experts in aesthetic technologies, alongside some of the best digital brains in the business, selfologi is set to be a game-changer and a pioneer in the multi-billion-dollar cosmetic treatments industry.\"\n\nThis innovative selfologi business is built on an equally innovative Composable Commerce architecture, providing selfologi the flexibility to deploy best-in-breed technology and bespoke customer experiences crafted to meet the unique needs of their business. Tacit Knowledge and selfologi worked with partners commercetools, Amplience, Algolia to deploy the ecommerce platform, which plans to be fully transactional in the coming months.\n\n\"The composable approach has moved discussions with the business from 'platform A only allows this feature in this particular way' to 'this is how and when we can deliver this feature'. In selfologi's case, this approach allowed them to go to market early with a content rich non-transactional website while the teams continue working to add commerce capabilities as quickly as possible. New features will be available online as soon as they are ready. This is a business-changing, strategic advantage in today's fast changing market,\" said Maneesh Kumar, Director of Technical Consulting and Delivery at Tacit Knowledge.\n\nOn Wednesday October 20, 2021, Grid Dynamics and Tacit Knowledge are hosting a Webinar: Winning with Composable Commerce: Success Story. Rob Pye, CEO of selfologi, will share some insights and lessons learned from his Composable Commerce journey and joining Rob will be industry experts - Michael Scholz, Global Director, Head of Product Marketing at commercetools and Maneesh Kumar, Director of Technical Consulting and Delivery at Tacit Knowledge.

                "title": "Researchers show Facebook's ad tools can target a single user",
                "body": "A new research paper written by a team of academics and computer scientists from Spain and Austria has demonstrated that it's possible to use Facebook's targeting tools to deliver an ad exclusively to a single individual if you know enough about the interests Facebook's platform assigns them.\n\nThe paper -- entitled Unique on Facebook: Formulation and Evidence of (Nano)targeting Individual Users with non-PII Data -- describes a \"data-driven model\" that defines a metric showing the probability a Facebook user can be uniquely identified based on interests attached to them by the ad platform.\n\nThe researchers demonstrate that they were able to use Facebook's Custom Audience tool to target a number of ads in such a way that each ad only reached a single, intended Facebook user.\n\nThe research raises fresh questions about potentially harmful uses of Facebook's ad targeting tools, and -- more broadly -- questions about the legality of the tech giant's personal data processing empire given that the information it collects on people can be used to uniquely identify individuals, picking them out of the crowd of others on its platform even purely based on their interests.\n\nThe findings could increase pressure on lawmakers to ban or phase out behavioral advertising -- which has been under attack for years, over concerns it poses a smorgasbord of individual and societal harms. And, at the least, the paper seems likely to drive calls for robust checks and balances on how such invasive tools can be used.\n\nThe findings also underscore the importance of independent research being able to interrogate algorithmic adtech -- and should increase pressure on platforms not to close down researchers' access.\n\n\"The results from our model reveal that the 4 rarest interests or 22 random interests from the interests set FB [Facebook] assigns to a user make them unique on FB with a 90% probability,\" write the researchers from Madrid's University Carlos III, the Graz University of Technology in Austria and the Spanish IT company, GTD System & Software Engineering, detailing one key finding -- that having a rare interest or lots of interests that Facebook knows about can make you easily identifiable on its platform, even among a sea of billions of other users.\n\n\"In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that addresses individuals' uniqueness considering a user base at the worldwide population's order of magnitude,\" they go on, referring to the scale inherent in Facebook's data mining of its 2.8BN+ active users (NB: the company also processes information about non-users, meaning its reach scales to even more Internet users than are active on Facebook).\n\nThe researchers suggest the paper presents the first evidence of \"the possibility of systematically exploiting the FB advertising platform to implement nanotargeting based on non-PII [interest-based] data\".\n\nThere have been earlier controversies over Facebook's ad platform being a conduit for one-to-one manipulative -- such as this 2019 Daily Dot article about a company called the Spinner which was selling a 'service' to sex-frustrated husbands to target psychologically manipulative messages at their wives and girlfriends. The suggestive, subliminally manipulative ads would pop up on the targets' Facebook and Instagram feeds.\n\nThe research paper also references an incident in UK political life, back in 2017, when Labour Party campaign chiefs apparently successfully used Facebook's Custom Audience ad-targeting tool to 'pull the wool' over former leader Jeremy Corbyn's eyes. But in that case the targeting was not just at Corbyn; it also reached his associates, and a few aligned journalists.\n\nWith this research the team demonstrates it's possible to use Facebook's Custom Audience tool to target ads at just one Facebook user -- a process they're referring to as \"nanotargeting\" (vs the current adtech 'standard' of microtargeting 'interest-based' advertising at groups of users).\n\n\"We run an experiment through 21 Facebook ad campaigns that target three of the authors of this paper to prove that, if an advertiser knows enough interests from a user, the Facebook Advertising Platform can be systematically exploited to deliver ads exclusively to a specific user,\" they write, adding that the paper provides \"the first empirical evidence\" that one-to-one/nanotargeting can be \"systematically implemented on FB by just knowing a random set of interests of the targeted user\".\n\nThe interest data they used for their analysis was collected from 2,390 Facebook users via a browser extension they created that the users had installed before January 2017.\n\nThe extension, called Data Valuation Tool for Facebook Users, parsed each user's Facebook ad preferences page to gather the interests assigned to them, as well as providing a real-time estimate about the revenue they generate for Facebook based on the ads they receive while browsing the platform.\n\nWhile the interest data was gathered before 2017, the researchers' experiments testing whether one-to-one targeting is possible through Facebook's ad platform took place last year.\n\n\"In particular, we have configured nanotargeting ad campaigns targeting three authors of this paper,\" they explain, discussing the results of their tests. \"We tested the results of our data-driven model by creating tailored audiences for each targeted author using combinations of 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 20, and 22 randomly selected interests from the list of interests FB had assigned them.\n\n\"In total, we ran 21 ad campaigns between October and November 2020 to demonstrate that nanotargeting is feasible today. Our experiment validates the results of our model, showing that if an attacker knows 18+ random interests from a user, they will be able to nanotarget them with a very high probability. In particular, 8 out of the 9 ad campaigns that used 18+ interests in our experiment successfully nanotargeted the chosen user.\"\n\nSo having 18 or more Facebook interests just got really interesting to anyone who wants to manipulate you.\n\nOne way to prevent one-to-one targeting would be if Facebook were to put a robust a limit on the minimum audience size.\n\nPer the paper, the adtech giant provides a \"Potential Reach\" value to advertisers using its Ads Campaign Manager tool if the potential audience size for a campaign is greater than 1,000 (or greater than 20, prior to 2018 when Facebook increased the limit).\n\nHowever the researchers found that Facebook does not actually prevent advertisers running a campaign targeting fewer users than those potential reach limits -- the platform just does not tell advertisers how many (or, well, few) people their messaging will reach.\n\nThey were able to demonstrate this by running multiple campaigns that successfully targeted a single Facebook user -- validating that the audience size for their ads was one by looking at data generated by Facebook's ad reporting tools (\"FB reported that only one user had been reached\"); having a log record in their web server generated by the (sole) user click on the ad; and -- in a third validation step -- they asked each nanotargeted user to collect a snapshot of the ad and its associated \"Why am I seeing this ad?\" option. Which they say matched their targeting parameters in the successfully nanotargeted cases.\n\n\"The main conclusions derived from our experiment are the following: (i) nanotargeting a user on FB is highly likely if an attacker can infer 18+ interests from the targeted user; (ii) nanotargeting is extremely cheap, and (iii) based on our experiments, 2/3 of the nanotargeted ads are expected to be delivered to the targeted user in less than 7 effective campaign hours,\" they add in a summary of the results.\n\nIn another section of the paper discussing countermeasures to prevent nanotargeting, the researchers argue that Facebook's claimed limits on audience size \"have been proven to be completely ineffective\" -- and assert that the tech giant's limit of 20 is \"not currently being applied\".\n\nThey also suggest there are workarounds for the limit of 100 that Facebook claims it applies to Custom Audiences (another targeting tool that involves advertisers uploading PII).\n\nFrom the paper:\n\n\"The most important countermeasure Facebook implements to prevent advertisers from targeting very narrow audiences are the limits imposed on the minimum number of users that can form an audience. However, those limits have been proven to be completely ineffective. On the one hand, Korolova et. al state that, motivated by the results of their paper, Facebook disallowed configuring audiences of size smaller than 20 using the Ads Campaign Manager. Our research shows that this limit is not currently being applied. On the other hand, FB enforces a minimum Custom Audience size of 100 users. As presented in Section 7.2.2, several works in the literature showed different ways to overcome this limit and implement nanotargeting ad campaigns using Custom Audiences.\n\nWhile the researchers refer throughout their paper to interest-based data as \"non-PII\" [aka, personally identifiable information] it is important to note that that framing is meaningless in a European legal context -- where the law, under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes a much broader view of personal data.\n\nPII is a more common term in the US -- which does not have comprehensive (federal) privacy legislation equivalent to the pan-EU GDPR.\n\nAdtech companies also typically prefer to refer to PII, given it's far more bounded a category vs all the information they actually process which can be used to identify and profile individuals to target them with ads.\n\nUnder the GDPR, personal data does not only include the obvious identifiers, like a person's name or email address (aka 'PII'), but can also encompass information that can be used -- indirectly -- to identify an individual, such as a person's location or indeed their interests.\n\nHere's the relevant chunk from the GDPR (Article 4(1)) [emphasis ours]:\n\n\"'personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\"\n\nOther research has also repeatedly -- over decades -- shown that re-identification of individuals is possible with, at times, just a handful of pieces of 'non-PII' information, such as credit card metadata or Netflix viewing habits.\n\nSo it should not surprise us that Facebook's vast people profiling, ad targeting empire, which continuously and pervasively mines Internet users' activity for interest-based signals (aka, personal data) to profile individuals for the purpose of targeting them with 'relevant' ads, has created a new attack vector for -- potentially -- manipulating almost anyone in the world if you know enough about them (and they have a Facebook account).\n\nBut that does not mean there are no legal problems here.\n\nIndeed, the legal basis that Facebook claims for processing people's personal data for ad targeting has been under challenge in the EU for years.\n\nThe tech giant used to claim that users consent to their personal data being used for ad targeting. However it does not offer a free, specific and informed choice to people over whether they want to be profiled for behavioral ads or just want to connect with their friends and family. (And free, specific and informed is the GDPR standard for consent.)\n\nIf you want to use Facebook you have to accept your information being used for ad targeting. This is what EU privacy campaigners have dubbed 'forced consent'. Aka, coercion, not consent.\n\nHowever, since the GDPR came into application (back in May 2018), Facebook has -- seemingly -- switched to claiming it's legally able to process Europeans' information for ads because users are actually in a contract with it to receive ads.\n\nA preliminary decision by Facebook's lead EU regulator, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), which was published earlier this week, has proposed to fine the company $36M for not being transparent enough about that silent switch.\n\nAnd while the DPC doesn't seem to have a problem with Facebook's ad contract claim, other European regulators disagree -- and are likely to object to Ireland's draft decision -- so the regulatory scrutiny over that particular Facebook GDPR complaint is ongoing and far from over.\n\nIf the tech giant is ultimately found to be bypassing EU law it could finally be forced to give users a free choice over whether their information can be used for ad targeting -- which would essentially blast an existential hole in its ad targeting empire, since even holding a few pieces of interest data is personal data, as this research underlines.\n\nFor now, though, the tech giant is using its customary tactic of denying there's anything to see here.\n\nIn a statement responding to the research, a Facebook spokesperson dismissed the paper -- claiming it is \"wrong about how our ad system works\".\n\nFacebook's statement goes on to try to divert attention from the researchers' core conclusions in an effort to minimize the significance of their findings -- with its spokesperson writing:\n\n\"This research is wrong about how our ad system works. The list of ads targeting interests we associate with a person are not accessible to advertisers, unless that person chooses to share them. Without that information or specific details that identify the person who saw an ad, the researchers' method would be useless to an advertiser attempting to break our rules.\"\n\nResponding to Facebook's rebuttal, one of the paper's authors -- Angel Cuevas -- described its argument as \"unfortunate\" -- saying the company should be deploying stronger countermeasures to prevent the risk of nanotargeting, rather than trying to claim there is no problem.\n\nIn the paper the researchers identify a number of harmful risks they say could be associated with nanotargeting -- such as psychological persuasion, user manipulation and blackmailing.\n\n\"It is surprising to find that Facebook is implicitly recognizing that nanotargeting is feasible and the only countermeasure is assuming advertisers are unable to infer users interests,\" Cuevas told TechCrunch.\n\n\"There are many ways interests could be inferred by advertisers. We did that in our paper with a browser plug-in (with explicit consent from users for research purposes). Even more, beyond interests there are other parameters (we did not use in our research) such as age, gender, city, zip code, etc.\n\n\"We think this is an unfortunate argument. We believe a player like Facebook can implement stronger countermeasures than assuming advertisers are unable to infer user interests to be later used to define audiences in the Facebook ads platform.\"\n\nOne might recall -- for example -- the 2018 Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal, where a developer that had access to Facebook's platform was able to extract data on millions of users, without most of the users' knowledge or consent -- via a quiz app.\n\nSo, as Cuevas says, it's not hard to envisage similarly opaque and underhand tactics being deployed by advertisers/attackers/agents to harvest Facebook users' interest data to try to manipulate specific individuals.\n\nIn the paper the researchers note that a few days after their nanotargeting experiment had ended Facebook shuttered the account they'd used to run the campaigns -- without explanation.\n\nThe tech giant did not respond to specific questions we put to it about the research, including why it closed the account -- and, if it did so because it had detected the nanotargeting issue, why it failed to prevent the ads running and targeting a single user in the first place.\n\nWhat might the wider implications be for Facebook's business as a result of this research?\n\nOne privacy researcher we spoke to suggested the research will certainly be useful for litigation -- which is growing in Europe, given the slow pace of privacy enforcement by EU regulators against Facebook specifically (and adtech more generally).\n\nAnother pointed out that the findings underline how Facebook has the ability to \"systematically re-identity\" users at scale -- \"while pretending it does not process 'personal data' on the data\" -- suggesting the tech giant has amassed enough data on enough people that it can, essentially, circumvent narrowly bounded legal restrictions that might seek to put limits on its processing of PII.\n\nSo regulators looking to put meaningful limits on harms that can flow from behavioral advertising will need to be wise to how Facebook's own algorithms can seek out and make use of proxies in the masses of data it holds and attaches to users -- and its likely line of associated argument that its processing therefore avoids any legal implications (a tactic Facebook has used on the issue of inferred sensitive interests, for example).\n\nAnother privacy watcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent privacy researcher and consultant, called the research staggering -- describing the paper as among the top ten most important privacy research results of this decade.\n\n\"Reaching 1 user out of 2.8bn? While the Facebook platform claimed there are precautions making such microtargeting impossible? So far, this is among the top 10 most important privacy research results in this decade,\" he told TechCrunch.\n\n\"It seems that users are identifiable by their interests in the meaning of article 4(1) of the GDPR, meaning that interests constitute personal data. The only caveat is that we are not certain how such a processing would scale [given the nanotesting was only tested on three users].\"\n\nOlejnik said the research shows the targeting is based on personal data -- and \"perhaps even special category data in the meaning of GDPR Article 9\".\n\n\"This would mean that the user's explicit consent is needed. Unless of course appropriate protections were made. But based on the paper we conclude that these, if present, are not sufficient,\" he added.\n\nAsked if he believes the research indicates a breach of the GDPR, Olejnik said: \"DPAs should investigate. No question about it,\" adding: \"Even if the matter may be technically challenging, building a case should take two days max.\"\n\nWe flagged the research to Facebook's lead DPA in Europe, the Irish DPC -- asking the privacy regulator whether it would investigate to determine if there had been a breach of the GDPR or not -- but at the time of writing it had not responded.\n\nOn the question of whether the paper strengthens the case for outlawing microtargeting, Olejnik argues that curbing the practice \"is the way forward\"- but says the question now is how to do that.\n\n\"I don't know if the current industry and political environment would be prepared for a total ban now. We should demand technical precautions, at the very least,\" he said. \"I mean, we were already told that these were in place but it appears this is not the case [in the case of nanotargeting on Facebook].\"\n\nOlejnik also suggested there could be changes coming down the pipe based on some of the ideas built into Google's Privacy Sandbox proposal -- which has, however, been stalled as a result of adtech complaints triggering competition scrutiny.\n\nAsked for his views on a ban on microtargeting, Cuevas told us: \"My personal position here is that we need to understand the tradeoff between privacy risks and economy (jobs, innovation, etc). Our research definitely shows that the adtech industry should understand that just thinking of PII information (email, phone, postal address, etc.) is not enough and they need to implement more strict measures regarding the way audiences can be defined.\n\n\"Saying that, we do not agree that microtargeting -- understood as the capacity of defining an audience with (at least) tens of thousands of users -- should be banned. There is a very important market behind microtargeting that creates many jobs and this is a very innovative sector that does interesting things that are not necessarily bad. Therefore, our position is limiting the potential of microtargeting to guarantee the privacy of the users.\"\n\n\"In the area of privacy we believe the open question that is not solved yet is the consent,\" he also said. \"The research community and the adtech ecosystem have to work (ideally together) to create an efficient solution that obtains the informed consent from users.\"\n\nZooming out, there are more legal requirements looming on the horizon for AI-driven tools in Europe.\n\nIncoming EU legislation for high risk applications of artificial intelligence -- which was proposed earlier this year -- has suggested a total ban on AI systems that deploy \"subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness in order to materially distort a person's behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm\".\n\nSo it's at least interesting to speculate whether Facebook's platform might face a ban under the EU's future AI Regulation -- unless the company puts proper safeguards in place that robustly prevent the risk of its ad tools being used to blackmail or psychologically manipulate individual users.\n\nFor now, though, it's lucrative business as usual for Facebook's eyeball targeting empire.\n\nAsked about plans for future research into the platform, Cuevas said the obvious next piece of work they want to do is to combine interests with other demographic information to see if nanotargeting is \"even easier\".\n\n\"I mean, it is very likely that an advertiser could can combine the age, gender, city (or zip code) of the user with a few interests to nanotarget a user,\" he suggested. \"We would like to understand how many of these parameters you need to combine. Inferring the gender, age, location and few interests from a user may be much easier than inferring few tens of interests.\"\n\nCuevas added that the nanotargeting paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference next month.",

                "body": "Photo-Illustration: Vulture; Photos by Twentieth Century Fox, Warner Bros, Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nFor over 40 years, director Ridley Scott has been opening the frame to visions of peerless grandeur, from the historical landscapes of Rome, the Middle Ages, and biblical Egypt to the vast emptiness of outer space and open water to the smog-choked cities of Los Angeles and Osaka, Japan. His facility with genre films was clear in the astonishing one-two-three punch that opened his career -- the absurdist swashbuckler The Duellists, the deep-space horror film Alien, and the sci-fi dystopia of Blade Runner -- but the true common denominator is a quest for beauty and a gift for allowing a fully realized backdrop to play a dominant role in the storytelling.\n\nOne surprising note on the list below: Scott has director's cuts of several of his films -- Blade Runner, Legend, Kingdom of Heaven, and The Counselor -- and all of them are improvements on the theatrical versions, often significantly better. The theatrical cut of Blade Runner, which added voiceover narration to help clarify the action, has been largely supplanted by the (slightly shorter) cut without voiceover, but the alternate versions of the others are not as easily found, especially on streaming. In the extreme case of Kingdom of Heaven, that's a full 50 minutes lost and the difference between a Gladiator rehash with a weak center and a much richer treatment of the Crusades and a deep-seated religious conflict that continues to this day.\n\nThere's an argument to be made that Scott peaked too soon or that he squandered his promise as a director of true science-fiction on a studio canvas. But even the worst films on this list are worlds worth getting lost in, because he invests so much creative and technical energy on atmosphere and image-making that those elements endure regardless of the parts that don't work. And when everything's going right, his best work has set a standard that other filmmakers have struggled to follow.\n\n26. 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992)\n\nBy far the better of the two competing Christopher Columbus films of 1992 -- the other, Christopher Columbus: The Discovery, was a calamity of historic proportions -- 1492: Conquest of Paradise nonetheless exposes Scott's weakness for obsessing over a sumptuous backdrop and losing engagement with the story happening in front of it. Gerard Depardieu is certainly a better Columbus than the other film's George Corraface, but no more dimensional: Here's a historical figure who's been a lightning rod in the debate over colonialism and its impact on indigenous peoples, but 1492 chooses to mythologize rather than interrogate. It's spectacularly beautiful when it hits the open water or explores the lush wonders of the New World, but the Columbus that emerges after 150 minutes is a dreamy cypher, an easy answer on a Social Studies test.\n\nAvailable to stream on Amazon Prime Video and Paramount+ Amazon Paramount+ 25. A Good Year (2006)\n\nBest known for Life in Provence and other best-selling memoirs about the eccentricities and splendors of southeastern France, Peter Mayle collaborated with Scott on the idea for A Good Year, a novel that more or less celebrates the same virtues. But Scott isn't a director who's adept at handling the deliberately slight -- ditto Russell Crowe, his star -- and the mismatch of sensibilities results in a film that spoils Mayle's delicate magic. The trite story sends Crowe's slick investment banker to his late uncle's rundown château and estate in Provence, where he's supposed to ready the property for sale, but winds up falling in sync with its soul-soothing rhythms. Rather than evoke the quirks of vineyard life, A Good Year sets up a crude choice between his cold life back in London or an earthly paradise full of wine and beautiful women. Easy call.\n\nAvailable to stream on Amazon Prime Video Amazon 24. Hannibal (2001)\n\nAside from Anthony Hopkins, the Oscar-sweeping team behind The Silence of the Lambs -- director Jonathan Demme, star Jodie Foster, and screenwriter Ted Tally -- all passed on Hannibal after Thomas Harris's novel came out in 1999. The screen adaptation is a good indicator why: Though the first film handled the serial-killer grotesquerie with chilling deftness, its true focus was Foster's Clarice Starling, a fledgling FBI agent trying to assert herself in a menacing, male-dominated world. Hannibal recasts Foster with Julianne Moore and then mostly marginalizes her in favor of an absolutely disgusting mano a mano between Hannibal Lecter and a previous victim (Gary Oldman) hellbent on revenge. Shooting in Florence, among other haunted locales, Scott pays homage to the ornate bloodletting of Italian giallo, but sinks into rank, witless exploitation.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 23. Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014)\n\nIn updating The Ten Commandments for the age of 3-D digital effects, Scott burned through $200 million to stage biblical miracles and plagues on a massive scale, but seems more interested in spectacle for its own sake than an expression of true spiritual conviction. Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton square off with appropriate intensity as Moses, who leads 600,000 Hebrew slaves on a perilous escape from Egypt, and his brother Ramses, the pharaoh who marshals his forces against him. Scott's commitment to historical accuracy has him explaining the bloody Nile and the parting of the Red Sea as more natural phenomena than acts of God, but it's never clear what religious point he wants to make. He worships at the altar of technique.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 22. Someone to Watch Over Me (1987)\n\nThe year was 1987. Tom Berenger and Mimi Rogers's stars were briefly ascendant. Sting was the choice to sing a George Gershwin standard over the opening credits. And the trend of sexy domestic shockers after Fatal Attraction hadn't yet kicked into gear, since that film had just come out a few weeks before. Someone to Watch Over Me is a product of its time, a serviceable romantic thriller that wound up looking chaste and old-fashioned next to the films that would soon flood the market in the same genre. Berenger and Rogers have solid opposites-attract chemistry as a working-class NYPD detective and the rich socialite he's assigned to protect from a ruthless killer, and Scott luxuriates in the moody corridors of New York's ultra-wealthy. But their class differences are mapped out too broadly, and the plotting is as off-the-rack as one of Berenger's suits.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 21. Black Rain (1989)\n\nAfter playing the dickish hero in Romancing the Stone, The Jewel of the Nile, and Fatal Attraction, and before playing the dickish hero in Basic Instinct, Falling Down, and Disclosure, Michael Douglas played a supremely dickish hero in Scott's thriller about a disgraced NYPD officer who takes on the Yakuza in Osaka, Japan. His cop-on-the-edge routine -- leather jacket, aviator glasses, motorcycle, bottomless petulance -- is overcranked, as is the cartoon menace of the criminal underground, which fed into a brief cultural freakout over Japanese dominance. Yet Black Rain is visually ravishing, capturing the smog-choked streets of Osaka with the intensity and dynamism of a first-rate graphic novel. The surface forgives a lot of what happens underneath.\n\nAvailable to stream on HBO Max HBO Max 20. G.I. Jane (1997)\n\nThere's not much to Scott's glossy exercise in battering-ram feminism: Woman gets thrown into a Navy SEALs-esque program to challenge military gender barriers. Woman succeeds despite relentless brutalization and assault. Woman says \"Suck my dick!\" G.I. Jane feels like a variation on Top Gun, by Scott's brother Tony, fetishizing the macho rituals of the naval elite and ending with a real-world demonstration of lessons learned on the training ground. There's not much room for nuance here -- the political horse-trading involved in creating this opportunity is particularly unconvincing -- and the film's leering eroticism undercuts the seriousness of its case for women as equals on the battlefield. But Demi Moore's fierce commitment to the role transforms her into a trash-art Joan of Arc, willing her place into a man's world.\n\nAvailable to stream on Showtime Showtime 19. Robin Hood (2010)\n\nIn the 1938 classic The Adventures of Robin Hood, Robin Hood is a happy iconoclast, meting out his form of social and political justice with the cheerful irreverence and deft strokes of Errol Flynn, cinema's premier swashbuckler. Scott's Robin Hood has a more historical bent, which is the first indicator that every last bit of fun has been drained out of it. In fun's place, Scott brings the grit and grime of 12th-century England to life and places Russell Crowe's Robin at the center of a battle against royal tyranny, albeit without wealth redistribution on his agenda. The immense scale does, however, yield battle sequences of thrilling scope and brutality, with arrows raining down from the skies and armies amassing by land and sea. It's Braveheart with a quiver.\n\nAvailable to stream on Peacock Peacock 18. Body of Lies (2008)\n\nBody of Lies has two of the biggest stars in the world and made over $100 million at the box office, but does anyone remember the first thing about it? It's a crisply directed thriller about the efforts of the CIA and Jordanian intelligence to break up a terrorist network, but Scott's career-long aversion to politics deprives it of a strong point of view. As a cat-and-mouse game between the authorities and a terrorist mastermind, Body of Lies is strictly by-the-numbers, but it does suggest a telling disconnect in the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio's operative and Russell Crowe's analyst: One on the ground in global trouble spots, the other making decisions from his home in Washington D.C., without respect to their real-world impact. There's a bit of commentary here about the arrogance of Americans dictating Middle East policy from afar, but the ins and outs of the mission take precedence.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 17. All the Money in the World (2017)\n\nWhen news broke about Kevin Spacey's sexual misconduct less than two months before All the Money in the World was due to be released, Scott hustled to replace him, casting Christopher Plummer as J. Paul Getty and hastily reshooting all of his scenes. What's particularly remarkable about the move is that Plummer's Getty dominates the film even when he's not onscreen. With his 16-year-old grandson held for ransom by Italian kidnappers in 1973 and the boy's mother (Michelle Williams) pleading for help, Getty shocks the world with his miserly callousness, saying, \"If I pay one penny now, then I'll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren.\" Scott handles the race-against-the-clock quality of the story cleanly, but it's Plummer's performance that's most compelling here. His Getty is both monstrous and emotionally isolated, walled in by a fortune that's doomed him to misfortune.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 16. White Squall (1996)\n\nLoosely based on a true event from 1960, when a storm wiped out the Albatross, a two-masted schooner that functioned as a school for seafaring young men, White Squall is more or less Dead Poets Society on water, with Jeff Bridges stepping into the Robin Williams role. Bridges's mercurial ship captain is a step up from Williams's manic oh-captain-my-captain, but the students themselves are a stock bunch of '60s squares and rebels in white tees (and without them), more compelling as physical specimens than psychological ones. As with 1492: Conquest of Paradise four years earlier, Scott drinks in the majesty of open water, but the film doesn't come fully to life until the title sequence, when the now-skilled and confident shipmates are humbled mercilessly by Mother Nature.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 15. Black Hawk Down (2001)\n\nBased on Mark Bowden's book about a team of Delta Force commandos and elite Army Rangers who engaged in ferocious battle on the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993, Black Hawk Down is a visceral you-are-there account told strictly from the point of view of American military men. There are serious problems with this approach, like the absence of context for the fight and the endless slaughter of faceless Somalis, but Scott burrows into the tactical details of a skirmish that wiped out 18 American soldiers and more than 500 Somalis. For Scott to take an apolitical approach to a politically loaded conflict is morally dubious, but it's hard to argue against the mastery of his staging, which gets both the overall strategy and the chaos on the ground persuasively right.\n\nAvailable to stream on HBO Max HBO Max 14. American Gangster (2007)\n\nBased on a New York Magazine profile of Frank Lucas, a vicious heroin magnate in the 1970s, American Gangster is a straightforward mob epic about a former chauffeur and protégé to Harlem kingpin Ellsworth \"Bumpy\" Johnson who seizes control of the business after his boss dies of a heart attack in 1968. Denzel Washington plays Lucas as a speak-softly-but-carry-a-big-stick type who likes to operate in the shadows, but strikes with overwhelming and often audacious brutality to defend his territory. His entrepreneurial venture into a pure Thai dope called \"Blue Magic\" draws heat from both the criminal underworld and an Essex County detective (Russell Crowe) fighting through a corrupt NYC police department. The gangster story is more compelling than the police-corruption story, but Scott brings them together in a vividly realized era where the city was a garden for lawlessness.\n\nAvailable to stream on Peacock Peacock 13. Kingdom of Heaven (2005)\n\nSeveral of Scott's films have \"Director's Cut\" editions, but he's the rare case where all of them are improvements on the theatrical cut, a couple of them significant. The director's version of Kingdom of Heaven, his massive Crusades epic, adds a full 50 minutes to the running time and creates a more coherent, immersive, and complex reading into 12th-century religious conflict and what it might teach us about contemporary tensions between Christians and Muslims. No cut of the film can redeem Orlando Bloom's ho-hum performance as a blacksmith who travels to Jerusalem to find spiritual solace after a family tragedy and ends up defending the city against a siege from the West. But Scott has never taken a bigger swing for the fences, and his sympathetic treatment of the Islamic world counts as a politically bold engagement with a relevant historical flashpoint.\n\nAvailable to stream on Starz Starz 12. Legend (1985)\n\nAfter kicking off his career with three straight classics, Scott ran aground with his fussily directed fantasy about unicorns, fairies, goblins, dwarves, and the fight to keep Darkness incarnate from descending on a beautiful forest kingdom. There's not much to the efforts of a spritely Tom Cruise to rescue a virginal princess (Mia Sara), but then again, storybook simplicity is a virtue in Legend, which is better than its reputation suggests, especially in a director's cut that's nearly 20 minutes longer than the theatrical version and restores a mesmerizing Jerry Goldsmith score. The world of the film is staggeringly beautiful, creating an oversize forest of enchantment and menace, capable of shifting from heavenly idyll in one scene to Grimm fairy tale in the next.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 11. Matchstick Men (2003)\n\nThere's a nobility that usually comes with characters who overcome disabilities, to say nothing of the actors who play them, but one of the dark pleasures of Matchstick Men is that triumph over adversity means being the most effective criminal possible. A fully committed Nicolas Cage stars as a con man who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette's, which complicates the pool-filtration scam he runs with his dirtbag protégé, played by a very funny Sam Rockwell. The script, co-authored by Ocean's Eleven writer Ted Griffin, is appropriately twisty and frequently hilarious, but there's some soul to Matchstick Men, too, particularly in Cage's relationship to the 14-year-old daughter (Alison Lohman) he didn't know he had.\n\nAvailable to stream on HBO Max HBO Max 10. The Last Duel (2021)\n\nOverseeing Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's first screenplay collaboration since Good Will Hunting -- albeit with a surely crucial co-writing credit to Nicole Holofcener -- Scott seems perfectly at home with the brutality and gore of a medieval kingdom where \"trial by combat\" is still an option to settle disputes. But his Rashomon-like story of a rape recalled from multiple performances brings the sexual politics of Thelma & Louise back into play, along with an unexpectedly bawdy spirit, sparked by Affleck's hilarious turn as a decadent count who scoffs at the case. The three leading turns -- by Jodie Comer as the intrepid victim, Damon as her husband and square-jawed knight, and Adam Driver as the accused squire -- are all excellent, and the film's insights into patriarchal power resonate through the centuries.\n\nAvailable in theaters Showtimes 9. Gladiator (2000)\n\nThe only Scott film to win Best Picture -- he's never won Best Director, losing this time to Traffic director Steven Soderbergh -- Gladiator is a throwback to giant sword-and-sandal spectacles like Ben-Hur and Spartacus, updated for the age of CGI. The scale of Gladiator explains its Oscar win more than its questionable depth, but Russell Crowe's brute charisma carries the day, as his fallen general survives betrayal and enslavement and hacks his way through various duels-to-the-death to exact vengeance upon the tyrant (Joaquin Phoenix) responsible for his downfall. Though dressed up with digital landscapes that advances in effects have rendered less impressive over time, the film is a classic hero's quest, rooted in family tragedy and redeemed by the righteousness and determination of a wronged man seeking justice. It's the rare Best Picture winner that would probably have a better reputation if it hadn't won.\n\nAvailable to stream on Netflix and Paramount+ Netflix Paramount+ 8. Alien: Covenant (2017)\n\nWith his sequel to Prometheus, Scott edges away from the earlier film's arty peculiarities to create something closer to a traditional entry in the Alien franchise, albeit still defined by austere craftsmanship, ornate celestial architecture, and some heady ideas about humanity facing its own extinction. It also develops David, the android played by Michael Fassbender, into a terrifically cold-blooded villain, whose agenda runs counter to the crew and colonists that make an unexpected landing on the alien-infested planet of Origae-6. Katherine Waterston steps up as a capable Ripley type who leads an increasingly decimated team through the paces, and Fassbender, in a dual performance as David and the kinder next-gen Walter, embodies both the promise and threat of artificial intelligence. The series Scott wound up starting with Alien had shifted into action-adventure in Aliens and the subsequent sequels, and here he takes it back to its cold, clinical roots.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 7. Prometheus (2012)\n\nScott's return to the sci-fi/horror that made his career is Alien-adjacent -- it \"shares strands of Alien's DNA,\" he said at the time -- but it's an odd duck, a prequel that attempts to deliver the gruesome monster-movie thrills of the franchise while exploring fundamental questions about the existence of man. Working with Lost co-creator and showrunner Damon Lindelof, who overhauled Jon Spaihts's original screenplay, Scott builds out Prometheus with a complicated mythology about astronauts on a journey to meet their creators, called \"the Engineers,\" and the dangers that confront their expedition. It takes patience (and multiple viewings) to sort through all the signs and wonders, much less reconcile these abstractions with the expected spasms of otherworldly terror, but Scott's insistence on diverting the Alien series toward a more unexpected and rapturously strange end pays off.\n\nAvailable to stream on Amazon Prime Video and Peacock Amazon Peacock 6. The Counselor (2013)\n\nOne of the worst-received films of Scott's career also happens to be one of his best, though the lion's share of the credit must go to Cormac McCarthy, who wrote the original screenplay and whose voice comes through more dominantly here than in the Coen brothers' adaptation of his novel No Country for Old Men. Through the deliberately standard-issue story of an amateur criminal (Michael Fassbender) trying to arrange a $20 million drug shipment from a Ciudad Juárez cartel, McCarthy stares into the abyss of human evil and the abyss stares back, pitilessly. Scott emphasizes the trappings and temptations of wealth and power as only he can, but as the scheme starts to unravel, McCarthy's philosophical monologues take over with a beauty and violence of their own. It's an odd film to say the least, between the talkiness that curbs any narrative momentum and eccentric flourishes, like a car-humping to rival anything in Titane. But Scott gives over so much to McCarthy that it has the feel of a great novel -- and a future cult classic.\n\nAvailable to stream on IMDb TV and Tubi IMDb TV Tubi 5. The Martian (2015)\n\nFilms often make virtues out of determination and the will to survive, but The Martian, based on Andy Weir's novel, does one better by valuing the importance of knowledge and intellectual rigor to achieve the unlikely. When Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is left for dead on Mars, shivved by flying debris and a dwindling oxygen supply, he has to puzzle out ways to extend his life on an uninhabitable planet on the faint hope that he'll get rescued. Though The Martian has a can-do attitude that's far from the doom-laden helplessness that overwhelms Alien, the two have in common a survivalist simplicity that arises from a single character who refuses to accept the seeming inevitability of failure. At a time when scientific process gets painted as voodoo in certain political circles, there's a meat-and-potatoes satisfaction to watching a film that makes straightforward problem-solving seem heroic.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes 4. Thelma & Louise (1991)\n\nThere are times when the bigness of Scott's directorial style feels ill-suited to the intimacies of Callie Khouri's script about women on the lam, but as Thelma & Louise has embedded itself in popular culture, the scope of the film seems more appropriate -- and, in certain moments, genuinely epochal. American road movies have often taken advantage of the Western landscape and the freedom it represents, but there's a unique power to the image of two women hitting the open road, at first to explore its possibilities and later to escape the law -- and the world of men -- as it encroaches on them. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon have exceptional chemistry in the lead roles, which are keenly written to contrast sharply but reveal compatible desires to escape from their drab, working-class lives. Considering its ending, it's striking how much Thelma & Louise has become a feminist touchstone of friendship and self-discovery, no matter how the journey ends.\n\nAvailable to stream on Paramount+ Paramount+ 3. The Duellists (1977)\n\nFor his brilliant debut feature, Scott reportedly took inspiration from the period lushness of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon two years before, but the absurdity of the ongoing conflict in The Duellists has more in common with one of Kubrick's anti-war films. Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel play French soldiers in Napoleon's army who nurture a decades-long grudge that occasionally results in them coming to blows in sword fights, jousts, and eventually pistols at dawn. Scott's mastery of genre and eye for natural beauty are apparent from the beginning, and he slyly mocks the rules of engagement for this ongoing conflict, which have to be suspended any time Carradine outranks Keitel or whenever Napoleon sends them into battle. Over time, however, their rivalry consumes their lives so wholly that compromise becomes impossible and escalation inevitable. It's a subtle allegory for how countries slide into war.\n\nAvailable to stream on Kanopy and to rent on Amazon Kanopy Amazon 2. Blade Runner (1982)\n\nThere's no overstating the impact Blade Runner had on future visions of science-fiction dystopias, if not more generally the neo-noir sheen that has become the default look of so many genre films about glittering cityscapes of rain and shadow. The opening shots paint 2019 Los Angeles as an unrecognizable place transformed by technology (flying cars!) and omnipresent advertising, and the scene on the ground anticipates the confusion and danger of androids infiltrating society and overwhelming their masters. The voiceover narration imposed by the studio for a theatrical version was a mistake -- unrewarded by critics and audiences, who were initially cool on the film -- but the director's cut (and later, \"The Final Cut\") allows for a stronger focus on Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a grimly determined cop assigned to hunt down a band of replicants gone rogue. Through his eyes, the world of Blade Runner becomes a journey through the land of misfit toys, a place humans once sought to control but have lost their grip on. The question of whether Deckard himself is a human or replicant is its own philosophy course on the nature of man, but Scott's sleek production hints at a future where we've ceded so much to technology that the answer to such a question will cease to matter.\n\nAvailable to stream on Netflix and HBO Max Netflix HBO Max 1. Alien (1979)\n\nThe sequels to Alien have been such free-for-all battles between humans and deadly extraterrestrials that it can be easy to forget the chilling simplicity of the original film, which needed only one creature to decimate the crew of a deep-space mining vessel ill-equipped to fight it. A candidate on any shortlist of the greatest horror films ever made, Alien borrows heavily from the hushed grandeur of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, particularly the ironic feeling of isolation that goes along with being stuck in the infinite. Sigourney Weaver's performance as Ellen Ripley, the warrant officer who holds her own against the threat, is an enduring picture of strength and resourcefulness, but Ripley is also a woman of principle, willing to make the difficult decisions that true leadership demands. If her decision not to let an infected crew member back onboard isn't overruled by her subordinates, the alien doesn't even make it onto the ship. The film is a potent nightmare of what a real extraterrestrial encounter might be like, with Ripley squaring off against a mysterious and hostile being, without the tools to stop it.\n\nAvailable to rent on Amazon and iTunes Amazon iTunes",

                "title": "Accelerating the discovery of new materials for 3D printing",
                "body": "The growing popularity of 3D printing for manufacturing all sorts of items, from customized medical devices to affordable homes, has created more demand for new 3D printing materials designed for very specific uses.\n\nTo cut down on the time it takes to discover these new materials, researchers at MIT have developed a data-driven process that uses machine learning to optimize new 3D printing materials with multiple characteristics, like toughness and compression strength.\n\nBy streamlining materials development, the system lowers costs and lessens the environmental impact by reducing the amount of chemical waste. The machine learning algorithm could also spur innovation by suggesting unique chemical formulations that human intuition might miss.\n\n\"Materials development is still very much a manual process. A chemist goes into a lab, mixes ingredients by hand, makes samples, tests them, and comes to a final formulation. But rather than having a chemist who can only do a couple of iterations over a span of days, our system can do hundreds of iterations over the same time span,\" says Mike Foshey, a mechanical engineer and project manager in the Computational Design and Fabrication Group (CDFG) of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and co-lead author of the paper.\n\nAdditional authors include co-lead author Timothy Erps, a technical associate in CDFG; Mina Konaković Luković, a CSAIL postdoc; Wan Shou, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas; senior author Wojciech Matusik, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT; and Hanns Hagen Geotzke, Herve Dietsch, and Klaus Stoll of BASF. The research was published today in Science Advances.\n\nOptimizing discovery\n\nIn the system the researchers developed, an optimization algorithm performs much of the trial-and-error discovery process.\n\nA material developer selects a few ingredients, inputs details on their chemical compositions into the algorithm, and defines the mechanical properties the new material should have. Then the algorithm increases and decreases the amounts of those components (like turning knobs on an amplifier) and checks how each formula affects the material's properties, before arriving at the ideal combination.\n\nThen the developer mixes, processes, and tests that sample to find out how the material actually performs. The developer reports the results to the algorithm, which automatically learns from the experiment and uses the new information to decide on another formulation to test.\n\n\"We think, for a number of applications, this would outperform the conventional method because you can rely more heavily on the optimization algorithm to find the optimal solution. You wouldn't need an expert chemist on hand to preselect the material formulations,\" Foshey says.\n\nThe researchers have created a free, open-source materials optimization platform called AutoOED that incorporates the same optimization algorithm. AutoOED is a full software package that also allows researchers to conduct their own optimization.\n\nMaking materials\n\nThe researchers tested the system by using it to optimize formulations for a new 3D printing ink that hardens when it is exposed to ultraviolet light.\n\nThey identified six chemicals to use in the formulations and set the algorithm's objective to uncover the best-performing material with respect to toughness, compression modulus (stiffness), and strength.\n\nMaximizing these three properties manually would be especially challenging because they can be conflicting; for instance, the strongest material may not be the stiffest. Using a manual process, a chemist would typically try to maximize one property at a time, resulting in many experiments and a lot of waste.\n\nThe algorithm came up with 12 top performing materials that had optimal tradeoffs of the three different properties after testing only 120 samples.\n\nFoshey and his collaborators were surprised by the wide variety of materials the algorithm was able to generate, and say the results were far more varied than they expected based on the six ingredients. The system encourages exploration, which could be especially useful in situations when specific material properties can't be easily discovered intuitively.\n\nFaster in the future\n\nThe process could be accelerated even more through the use of additional automation. Researchers mixed and tested each sample by hand, but robots could operate the dispensing and mixing systems in future versions of the system, Foshey says.\n\nFarther down the road, the researchers would also like to test this data-driven discovery process for uses beyond developing new 3D printing inks.\n\n\"This has broad applications across materials science in general. For instance, if you wanted to design new types of batteries that were higher efficiency and lower cost, you could use a system like this to do it. Or if you wanted to optimize paint for a car that performed well and was environmentally friendly, this system could do that, too,\" he says.\n\nBecause it presents a systematic approach for identifying optimal materials, this work could be a major step toward realizing high performance structures, says Keith A. Brown, assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Boston University.\n\n\"The focus on novel material formulations is particularly encouraging as this is a factor that is often overlooked by researchers who are constrained by commercially available materials. And the combination of data-driven methods and experimental science allows the team to identify materials in an efficient manner. Since experimental efficiency is something with which all experimenters can identify, the methods here have a chance of motivating the community to adopt more data-driven practices,\" he says.\n\nThe research was supported by BASF",

                "body": "Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nTech trends can change on a dime -- for example, the Covid-19 pandemic caused many companies to reactively switch their tech focus to enabling and supporting remote work. Still, industry watchers generally have insight into likely upcoming developments -- they named cybersecurity and the Internet of Things as trends to watch in 2021, and there's no doubt these topics have generated plenty of headlines this year.\n\nThe tech experts of Forbes Technology Council have their own predictions about the technologies and trends they believe will dominate not only the tech industry but business in general in the year ahead. From continued upgrades to artificial intelligence, voice search and battery technology to the rise of \"citizen developers,\" here are their predictions and reasons for new and continuing tech trends in 2022.\n\n1. Automation\n\nThe critical focus in 2022 will be on automation. Similar to the shift from labor arbitrage to effective production using automation in the industrial space, I predict that technologies such as robotic process automation, natural language processing and intelligent document processing will continue to reduce dependence on human labor for subjective tasks. - Ahmed Zaidi, Accelirate\n\n2. Predictive Analytics\n\nTogether, data analytics, data lake consolidation and predictive analysis are going to be big trends in the entire IT industry. Even the IoT and cybersecurity are heavily driven by advanced predictive analytics techniques. Predictive analytics tools are going to be big game-changers in almost every industry and in every domain of business. - Nilesh Jain, Trend Micro\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\n3. Focus On Software Quality Standards\n\nThe trend for 2022 and beyond will be a focus on quality. Software solutions will be embedded in our day-to-day lives and in most of the goods and appliances we are using. Consequently, software will have to meet the quality standards of the manufacturing industry. Currently, this is rarely the case, which leads to issues, such as the problems with Boeing's MCAS system, which caused the Boeing 737 MAX accidents. - Andreas Golze, Cognizant\n\n4. Smart City Technologies\n\nSmart city technologies will continue to be a rising software trend into 2022 and beyond. The rapid growth of the urban population is creating a need for more effective and efficient cities. Smart cities fill that need by facilitating collaboration across diverse agencies, departments and organizations, resulting in more integrated services for a better and more sustainable citizen experience. - Kalyn Sims, Hexagon's Safety & Infrastructure Division\n\n5. Web 3.0\n\nWeb 3.0, comprising AI-driven services, decentralized data architectures and edge computing, is the next big trend. AI determines what you're looking for and puts additional ideas in front of you. Decentralized data architectures reshape peer-to-peer transactions. Edge computing, along with the rise of 5G, accelerates user connections. As these three come together, the next industrial revolution will be upon us. - Jordan McQuown, George Jon\n\n6. Low-Code/No-Code Solutions\n\n2022 will continue to see growth in low-code/no-code solutions and the rise of the citizen developer movement. Access to enterprise-grade technology has been democratized, allowing companies of all sizes to modernize. Similarly, access to purpose-built solutions designed for the unique use cases of a business will empower employees to both identify issues and to implement and iterate ways to solve data and process challenges. - Shaheen Yazdani, Intercept\n\n7. Transparency About Software\n\nMore people will demand to know what their software is made of. Whether it's a \"nutrition label,\" \"bill of materials\" or something similar, organizations will demand that vendors account for all the software used in apps and devices, where the software came from, how it was built and tested, and how it's being maintained. In a few years, selling opaque software will be the exception rather than the rule. - Sammy Migues, Synopsys Software Integrity Group\n\n8. Adoption Of Cloud Technology\n\nThere is no doubt that the adoption of cloud technology will continue to grow. As Covid-19 lingers, companies are continuing the adoption of cloud infrastructures. If you run a company with employees located around the globe, cloud technology is a great way to make applications available to your employees that enable them to collaborate and be productive. Open-source technology is there to help with the adoption. - Manish Mittal, OpenSource Technologies Inc.\n\n9. Deep Fakes\n\nLook for deep fakes -- that is, AI-powered forgeries that use social engineering techniques to deceive -- to move from novelties to potential calamities in 2022. While the deployment of these technologies can affect everything from public policy to social media platforms, their most corrosive impact on any enterprise is the undermining of trust. - Adam Stern, Infinitely Virtual\n\n10. Voice Search Technology\n\nI believe we will see more businesses make use of voice search technology in 2022. We've made tremendous strides in how we reach our customers through voice-search-specific keywords and optimization. But we expect to see the AI that \"listens\" to users get more sophisticated and useful in the coming years. - Thomas Griffin, OptinMonster\n\n11. Teleworking\n\nTeleworking will continue to rise in 2022 and will bring advancements in software development. Companies worldwide will need to support hybrid forms of team management and collaboration so that their workforces' productivity can grow. This new normal will expand even further in 2022, as the trend of conducting online meetings and video sales calls continues. - Adi Ekshtain, Amaryllis Payment Solutions\n\n12. Battery Tech\n\nBattery tech has been gaining traction for a while now, and 2022 is going to be a critical year for it. Progress is being made on two fronts. We're seeing increasing efficiency for existing electric-powered devices such as cars, scooters, phones and so on. Additionally, we're making more things that are powered by electricity, including airplanes. More funding from both government and private sectors is sure to lead us to a cleaner world. - Vikram Joshi, pulsd\n\n13. Cyber Scoring\n\nThe new trend will be having a single risk monitor for your complete IT stack. It is important to be able to communicate your cybersecurity levels to people from different walks of life. A cyber score will be as important as a credit score in the future. Organizations will be required to maintain a certain number to qualify as safe. - Trishneet Arora, TAC Security\n\n14. Ethical AI\n\nWhile AI technology provides tremendous benefits, it's facing challenges and posing risks to people when it comes to data security, data privacy and digital ethics. The tech industry will continue to discuss and develop common ethical principles, guidelines, policies and regulations to ensure that AIs being built will demonstrate ethical behaviors. - Zheng Fan, University of Miami Herbert Business School\n\n15. Non-Fungible Tokens\n\nIn 2022 we will see companies dabbling in the creation of NFTs for a fee. The adoption of NFTs in the arts and entertainment space has been increasing exponentially in 2021, thus requiring expertise from organizations that understand the tokenization process and requirements.

                "title": "Sisense BrandVoice: Welcome To The Next Generation Of Business Intelligence",
                "body": "The Business Intelligence industry has long promised a future where every worker can use data to make smarter business decisions. Although that promise continues to be out of reach for most companies, the industry has come a long way over the past few decades, and we believe we are on the cusp of a new generation of BI that will finally turn that promise into reality.\n\nWe started with \"Gen One\" BI - on-premises data and heavy-IT driven reporting projects - which was burdensome for both IT teams and end users. While cumbersome and requiring heavy investments, a few enterprises overcame those hurdles and reaped big benefits, lighting the spark for analytics.\n\nNext, we entered the era of data democratization and self-service, or \"Gen Two\" BI, which focused on making data more consumable, easy to use and accessible by putting the power of analytics tools into the hands of business users. Although more organizations adopted Gen Two BI and gave out more licenses than ever, this generation's fundamental flaw was its focus on dashboards and analytics itself. We asked business users to also become analysts, to step out of their daily workflows to build or find dashboards to leverage data. The result is that adoption of data analytics continues to be a struggle as data volume and complexity grows, with only 24% of firms claiming to have created a data-driven organization, an actual decline from prior years!\n\nIt is time for a third generation of BI. Like the iPhone, which built on two generations of cell phones and smartphones and finally put mobile technology into the hands of every consumer, this new generation of BI will take the best of the two previous generations and finally empower every worker to make smart, data-driven decisions.\n\nThis will be \"Gen Three\" BI, and we call it: the Age of Action.\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\nBusiness intelligence is built on an old data culture that relies on technical experts. In the early days of reporting, those experts were called IT. As technology evolved and tools became easier, the progression of BI moved to reports and dashboards delivered by new experts -- analysts. This made analytics more accessible, but still didn't make self-service data insights a reality across the business. Here's why: Instead of using technology to put data in front of people where they already are working, we continue to ask people to leave their business apps and turn to dedicated tools or dashboards for answers.\n\nThis process is disruptive and inefficient, and often causes users to write it off completely. Dashboards don't have built-in analytics processes; they share information but do not provide recommended courses of action at the right moment or in a decision maker's workflow. Business professionals want exactly that: They want a final answer and recommendations on what to do next. They would rather have data and actionable insights come in easily digestible bites versus needing to dig for answers in dashboards and reports. And the truth is they are digging; dashboards are often too broad to address multiple questions, too difficult to customize, and frankly, have too many insights.\n\nFor analytics to advance, we must extend dashboards or deliver personalized intelligence to more decision makers . In fact, Gartner predicts that \"dashboards will be replaced with automated, conversational, mobile and dynamically generated insights customized to a user's needs and delivered to their point of consumption. This shifts the insight knowledge from a handful of data experts to anyone in the organization.\" Now, instead of wasting time jumping from where the data resides (in dashboards) to where work is done, embedded analytics enables users to do both simultaneously: get insights and take action.\n\nAnalytics must come to us.\n\nThe keyword in Gartner's prediction above is automation. We cannot talk about moving beyond the dashboard without acknowledging the role that artificial intelligence plays in this next phase of analytics. Advancements in AI means we can now scan entire data warehouses in seconds, answer the toughest analytical questions and track meaningful changes in data in real time. And we can do all this without lifting a finger or calling in experts.\n\nPrevious generations of BI gave us technology like data visualization to make data more understandable, the cloud to enable access from anywhere or any device, and extensible frameworks so we can embed data into other applications. Today, when we combine that technology with AI, we can extract data insights and embed them into our CRM, workplace collaboration apps, custom business apps, etc. Instead of asking users to pause their jobs and dig through dashboards for answers, we can put digestible insights and expert knowledge in the apps they are already using.\n\nIn this type of world, technology fades into the background. Business workers are in and out of their apps and barely aware that they're using analytics at all. They're simply getting the answers they need, making smarter decisions and moving on to the next task. Taking action based on data becomes seamless, automatic and instinctive for all.\n\nPsychologists estimate that we make an average of 35,000 decisions each day. As consumers, we make many of those decisions with the help of data analytics, even if we don't realize it. We turn to our smart devices for insights about traffic patterns, exercise goals, financial spending habits, and more. Often, those insights come to us automatically in our apps, and sometimes in advance before we know we need it. As a result, we make better-informed decisions, thanks to personalized data.\n\nThis is how decision-making should be in businesses too. Every day, our employees, partners and customers also make decisions that impact the bottom line; why wouldn't we expect the same level of insight in the workplace? In the Age of Action, insights arising from analytics and AI are no longer a luxury, but a necessity for achieving competitive advantages, whether in employee- or customer-facing apps and workflows.\n\nMany businesses are already taking advantage of this new generation of BI. Take GE for example, which embeds analytics into their scheduling software for more than 150 hospitals, helping them predict no shows and cancellations for MRI and CT scans.\n\nOr Air Canada, which has hundreds of gigabytes of data on safety-related KPIs. They've integrated AI and analytics into corporate safety processes for their front-line employees so airplane parts can be flagged and replaced before the part fails.\n\nOr non-profit software company Tessitura Network, which during COVID-19, served data insights to more than 650 performing arts and cultural organizations through APIs so they could improve fundraising, analyze capacity, and manage canceled events.\n\nThis is what business intelligence promised decades ago. It's businesses of all sizes and types, putting personalized, actionable analytics in the hands of all users where they are. No more heavy IT projects with long turnaround times. No more distracting dashboards or attempts to turn everybody into analysts.\n\n\"Let's look at the data\" will become a phrase of the past. The data will already be where business workers want it, when they want it, without them asking for it. They will have their insights, they will make the decisions they need to and then they will move on.",

                "body": "Expertise from Forbes Councils members, operated under license. Opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nChief Digital Officer of Paradigm Technology. 25+ years leading Digital Transformation through Advanced Analytics & Cloud Data Engineering.\n\nIn the world of digital transformation, trends in data and analytics are having a disruptive impact across all industries.\n\nBeing a chief digital officer (CDO) in the digital space, my goal is to help make the digital revolution an opportunity for all of my customers and to provide a bridge between technology and society. Making that transformational shift requires harnessing the power of data, driving service excellence, focusing on the customer and delivering products in an agile manner.\n\nAccording to an Everest Group study, \"73% of enterprises failed to realize sustained returns on their digital investments.\" Frequent business interruptions and economic inflations are fueling newer business opportunities, leading organizations to create, process and manage newer data assets. It's critical that the quality of such data is trustworthy in making effective decisions.\n\nEnabling such trustworthiness would mean requirements such as:\n\n* Significant time from data subject matter experts (SMEs) in determining measurement rules.\n\n* Additional efforts from data engineering and development teams to implement heuristics with measurement rules and capture outcomes.\n\n* Reprioritization of existing initiatives to meet business demands at a faster pace.\n\nHarnessing the power of data helps infuse artificial intelligence (AI) with expanded computation power and considers a cloud-native technology trend for extracting value-added benefits, ultimately enabling near-real-time insights and personalization. AI-driven digital intelligence helps service and sales models strategize based on convenience and inspiration for internal and external customers, delivering improved insights and retention.\n\nAI and analytics enable greater agility for consumer needs and help to effectively evaluate new ways to drive product innovation and market launch. Keeping the customer at the forefront -- understanding consumer behavior through analysis of social, internal and external data -- is key to drumming up effective customer engagement.\n\nLet's look at some of the key approaches that need to be enabled for data and analytics to foster disruption with digital transformation:\n\n* Embark on a transformation journey with a mindset of thinking big, starting small and scaling fast.\n\n* Increase connections with more than 1 billion consumers via meaningful, relevant dialogue.\n\n* Use several digital ecosystem capabilities (social and business analytics, e-commerce support, website management, social media management, etc.).\n\n* Transform a model based on insights -- develop data-driven strategies and insights for campaign planning.\n\n* Centralize data and define a services catalog optimized and industrialized with insightful services that are faster, better and cheaper.\n\n* Blend data and business intelligence (BI) activities into an analytics center of excellence (COE).\n\n* Integrate data sources and analytics for real-time insights and recommendations to people-related questions.\n\n* Industrialize an integrated \"hub and spoke\" model through a partner ecosystem.\n\nDoing the above can be a benefit in the long run, future-proofing for advantages such as:\n\n* Embarking on a three-year transformation program with a single template across business functions globally.\n\n* Developing more customer-centric marketing plans leveraging real-time insights.\n\n* Better decision-making based on customers using data-driven insights to support customer trends, campaign planning, market and competitor insights and unplanned events.\n\n* Better information enabling process improvements (e.g., speed to market, channel analysis, consumer insights that support planning for consumer trends, campaign planning, market, competitor insights and unplanned events).\n\nLet's imagine we are in 2022 -- post-pandemic, where most organizations have started or are well on their digital transformation journeys. Digital leadership teams will have to implement serious guardrails and well-defined plans of action. These plans should not be limited to just platforms, tools and social networks, but they should enable resiliency to keep thriving and driving insights by:\n\n* Reducing complexity and costs by embarking on programs like data estate modernization, data platform managed services and financial transformation.\n\n* Increasing transparency by setting up an analytics COE and experimenting in a sandbox environment.\n\n* Improving execution by adapting to AI-driven infusion powered by hyper-personalization.\n\nSteve Jobs once said: \"Innovation is the ability to see opportunity -- not a threat.\" Based on experience and best practice, digital transformation is 60% mindset, 25% methodologies, 10% tools and 5% other. A high degree of digital transformation brings about challenges and, depending upon the organizational structure, can change or heavily impact a business unit's status quo (think resources, internal and external stakeholder support, and strategies to launch quickly and successfully).\n\nOrganizations can overcome these challenges by influencing and empowering others with insights-driven information that enables day-to-day data consumption needs. Engaging a robust governance model and appointing digital transformation stewards to experiment and promote these data-driven outcomes is also recommended. This will, however, all depend on how susceptible individual lines of business are to the change and how quickly they are willing to adapt.\n\nWhat should a CDO's vision be for transforming organizations into intelligent enterprises? Enterprises need to define and enable a data-led approach, leveraging cloud for next-gen data platforms and analytics. Embedding and evolving a decision science and insights-driven culture alongside monetizing data assets can unlock value through new business models. Lastly, the key to building trusted data is managed governance and data lineage.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

                "title": "Machine-learning system accelerates discovery of new materials for 3D printing",
                "body": "The growing popularity of 3D printing for manufacturing all sorts of items, from customized medical devices to affordable homes, has created more demand for new 3D printing materials designed for very specific uses.\n\nTo cut down on the time it takes to discover these new materials, researchers at MIT have developed a data-driven process that uses machine learning to optimize new 3D printing materials with multiple characteristics, like toughness and compression strength.\n\nBy streamlining materials development, the system lowers costs and lessens the environmental impact by reducing the amount of chemical waste. The machine learning algorithm could also spur innovation by suggesting unique chemical formulations that human intuition might miss.\n\n\"Materials development is still very much a manual process. A chemist goes into a lab, mixes ingredients by hand, makes samples, tests them, and comes to a final formulation. But rather than having a chemist who can only do a couple of iterations over a span of days, our system can do hundreds of iterations over the same time span,\" says Mike Foshey, a mechanical engineer and project manager in the Computational Design and Fabrication Group (CDFG) of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and co-lead author of the paper.\n\nAdditional authors include co-lead author Timothy Erps, a technical associate in CDFG; Mina Konaković Luković, a CSAIL postdoc; Wan Shou, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas; senior author Wojciech Matusik, professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT; and Hanns Hagen Geotzke, Herve Dietsch, and Klaus Stoll of BASF. The research was published today in Science Advances.\n\nOptimizing discovery\n\nIn the system the researchers developed, an optimization algorithm performs much of the trial-and-error discovery process.\n\nA material developer selects a few ingredients, inputs details on their chemical compositions into the algorithm, and defines the mechanical properties the new material should have. Then the algorithm increases and decreases the amounts of those components (like turning knobs on an amplifier) and checks how each formula affects the material's properties, before arriving at the ideal combination.\n\nThen the developer mixes, processes, and tests that sample to find out how the material actually performs. The developer reports the results to the algorithm, which automatically learns from the experiment and uses the new information to decide on another formulation to test.\n\n\"We think, for a number of applications, this would outperform the conventional method because you can rely more heavily on the optimization algorithm to find the optimal solution. You wouldn't need an expert chemist on hand to preselect the material formulations,\" Foshey says.\n\nThe researchers have created a free, open-source materials optimization platform called AutoOED that incorporates the same optimization algorithm. AutoOED is a full software package that also allows researchers to conduct their own optimization.\n\nMaking materials\n\nThe researchers tested the system by using it to optimize formulations for a new 3D printing ink that hardens when it is exposed to ultraviolet light.\n\nThey identified six chemicals to use in the formulations and set the algorithm's objective to uncover the best-performing material with respect to toughness, compression modulus (stiffness), and strength.\n\nMaximizing these three properties manually would be especially challenging because they can be conflicting; for instance, the strongest material may not be the stiffest. Using a manual process, a chemist would typically try to maximize one property at a time, resulting in many experiments and a lot of waste.\n\nThe algorithm came up with 12 top performing materials that had optimal tradeoffs of the three different properties after testing only 120 samples.\n\nFoshey and his collaborators were surprised by the wide variety of materials the algorithm was able to generate, and say the results were far more varied than they expected based on the six ingredients. The system encourages exploration, which could be especially useful in situations when specific material properties can't be easily discovered intuitively.\n\nFaster in the future\n\nThe process could be accelerated even more through the use of additional automation. Researchers mixed and tested each sample by hand, but robots could operate the dispensing and mixing systems in future versions of the system, Foshey says.\n\nFarther down the road, the researchers would also like to test this data-driven discovery process for uses beyond developing new 3D printing inks.\n\n\"This has broad applications across materials science in general. For instance, if you wanted to design new types of batteries that were higher efficiency and lower cost, you could use a system like this to do it. Or if you wanted to optimize paint for a car that performed well and was environmentally friendly, this system could do that, too,\" he says.",

                "body": "Medicare Advantage For All Can Save Our Health-Care System\n\nGeorge Halvorson, former CEO of Kaiser Permanente, and Dr. Mehmet Oz propose here a quick and comprehensive way to provide Americans with universal health-care coverage and better health care, especially poor, underserved communities. How? By having health insurance bought through the highly successful Medicare Advantage program. One-third of people on Medicare have opted for Medicare Advantage because beneficiaries get better care thanks to competing plans. As the authors explain, Medicare Advantage could be expanded quickly and would be infinitely better than the highly-flawed idea of Medicare for All. A timely and important piece, to say the least!\n\nWe need a mechanism to urgently fund health-care sites decimated by our nation's Covid-19 response. Simultaneously, poorer Americans, many of whom are Black and Latino, are suffering disproportionately during the crisis because of the poor-quality health care available to them, which has been an ongoing problem in this country for generations. We offer a proven solution to both crises that should attract enough Democrats and Republicans to improve our health-care financing landscape.\n\nA concerning percentage of American hospitals and medical groups will fall into financial failure over the next several months. Their fee-for-service model, which has created dysfunctional and expensive incentives in health-care for decades, also suffocated their cash flow when the pandemic limited lucrative medical procedures.\n\nWe should be on the cusp of a golden age in health-care delivery that uses all of the best patient-support tools to deliver continuously improved care. Instead, the piecework way in which we buy almost all of our services today will keep that golden age from happening for the vast majority of American patients for the foreseeable future. We need an approach to buying health care that can give security to all Americans concerned about the quality and cost of care, while also creating a resilient health-care system for future health crises.\n\nWe could achieve these goals by buying health-care coverage for every American who is not on Medicaid through the Medicare Advantage program, which a third of Medicare beneficiaries already use very successfully. We could fund this universal coverage entirely with full financial security by using an affordable 20% payroll tax, which is close to the amount most employers currently spend to buy insured care. Half would be paid by employers, so individual Americans would pay no more than 10% of their income to pay for much better coverage than is currently available to most.\n\nThis particular path to universal coverage isn't a new approach nor unique to us. Most countries in Western Europe today use payroll taxes to create protected separate streams of money that each country uses to efficiently buy health care -- and most of those countries also use health plans that are similar to Medicare Advantage to actually provide the coverage for each person. No one in Switzerland or the Netherlands is on a government-run single-payer program. Instead, each country has highly functioning and directly competing health plans funded by a payroll tax that creates the revenue streams for their citizens' health care. They intentionally use a separate payroll tax to keep the health-care dollars in their governmental budgets separate from general revenues and expenditures.\n\nSome in the U.S. have argued for extending our standard Medicare program to all Americans, but this would be more difficult on multiple levels. Our government doesn't directly administer standard Medicare today, and doing so would require an entirely new infrastructure with intermediaries. More important, that would continue the highly dysfunctional approach of buying every item of care by the piece, which incentivizes abuse and cripples systematic process improvement.\n\nIn contrast, Medicare Advantage has negotiated payment rates with care providers and already has extensive care networks that could be expanded very quickly to fill gaps needed for our newly insured Americans to receive their care. Medicare Advantage also has much better benefits, care coordination, quality controls, levels of performance accountability and cash-flow models for implementing and delivering continuously improving models of care. Accordingly, the government pays each private insurance company that manages Medicare Advantage plans a fixed amount of money each month for each covered person, which incentivizes quality over quantity of care.\n\nWe could expand the Medicare Advantage program next year to nonseniors and cover all Americans who are not on Medicaid with a new dedicated 20% payroll tax on all workers. This would exactly copy the approach used now with the Social Security payroll-tax process. As the starting point for every work site, the 20% tax would be split 50-50 between employers and employees; any employer that wanted to increase its percentage could do so at its own discretion.\n\nMost employers that offer health-care coverage to their employees currently pay more than this percentage for coverage and would benefit in future years by avoiding the painful annual increases in health-insurance-coverage expenses. For the 30% or more of work sites that don't offer health-care benefits to their employees, the new tax would increase their current operating costs per employee by only 10%, an amount less than many anticipate for Covid-related expenses.\n\nAmerica would use this pool of money to buy Medicare Advantage for the purpose of creating universal coverage -- coverage with a $1,000 deductible for everyone who is not already on Medicaid. The Medicare Advantage plans would be paid a monthly payment from this tax pool for each member who chooses them. Being paid by the month and not by the piece would free the plans and caregivers from the perverse consequences of being paid fees for each piece of care and from being dependent on individual pieces of care for their cash flows.\n\nMore than 70% of the health care costs in America today come from chronic diseases, and standard Medicare providers make more money when their patients are in poor health. They even benefit when their piece-work-payment-model patients have health disasters or medical complications. In contrast, Medicare Advantage plans benefit financially when people have fewer heart attacks, lower levels of diabetic complications, fewer asthma attacks and lower levels of chronic diseases. Accordingly, Medicare Advantage plans have strong incentives to reduce the number of congestive-heart-failure crises rather than benefiting financially when those crises happen. So, the number of heart-failure crises has been reduced by a third or more when people have enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nThe Medicare Advantage approach to buying care by the month and not by the piece uses a purchasing model that demands impeccable service levels with a team approach and accurate care-quality reporting. The philosophy encourages efficiency, health promotion, extensive systems support and more patient-focused use of health-care dollars to sustain the program over time.\n\nWhen using this approach, Medicare fraud actually disappears entirely as a government expense, because the payment for each patient in a Medicare Advantage plan is a monthly capitation and not a fee-payment system; there are no relevant piece-work payments, which are what invite, enable and allow most Medicare fraud today. You can also raise your concern to Medicare fraud attorney to deal with such cases effectively & efficiently.\n\nBy using this approach we could also significantly reduce administrative costs as a country. The complex array of payers in our hodgepodge payment non system that has created a massive administrative burden would shrink significantly -- and once instituted, the universal Medicare Advantage plans should be obligated to reducing excess administrative costs by a third.\n\nThe best part: We could expand Medicare Advantage with tools that are already in place. We don't need any new infrastructure with hidden costs and risks. We already have a Social Security payroll-tax-collection mechanism in place. We already have Medicare Advantage plans in place with fully supported infrastructures for both buyers and payers. We could apply new actuarial calculations to distribute the capitation payments from the new program to each of the private health-insurance plans using tools and cash-flow processes that are also entirely in place today for Medicare Advantage patients.\n\nWe're going to need a new name for this program. From now on let's call it \"Medical Advantage.\"\n\nWe've done a number of dramatic and sometimes heroic things to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. This specific response to the crisis would give us a long-term benefit that we could look back on with pride and satisfaction. After we had used this approach for a few years and enjoyed the fruits of team care, connected care, and artificial-intelligence-supported patterns of care, we'd wonder why we ever bought care in any other way and would fiercely resist anyone who wanted to mess in any way with our Medical Advantage.\n\n-- George Halvorson, CEO, Institute for InterGroup Understanding, former CEO Kaiser Permanente\n\n-- Mehmet Oz, M.D., Attending Physician, New York Presbyterian/Columbia, host of The Dr. Oz Show",

                "title": "Invoking 'Big Tech' as an accusation can endanger American security | TheHill - The Hill",
                "body": "Could Congress's antitrust campaign against Big Tech derail America's strategic competition with China? A bipartisan collection of senior national security leaders -- including a former Secretary of Defense, former Director of National Intelligence, former CIA executives, and a former White House Homeland Security adviser -- think so, and we would do well to listen.\n\nIn a letter written to Congress last month, this diverse group of notables warned that \"more deliberate analysis is needed to examine the detrimental impact\" that a slew of proposed antitrust laws targeting Big Tech could have on American power.\n\nTheir misgivings are well-founded: One of these proposals, for example, would amend legislation on anti-competitive monopolies such that any company with a market cap of more than $100 billion would be prevented from making any merger or acquisition.\n\nThough this particular proposal thankfully has not gained much traction, it is representative of the kinds of poorly considered, far-reaching bills that should have us all concerned. For their proponents, the term \"Big Tech\" is often invoked as an accusation, implying that the scale of these companies alone means they need to be broken up. This approach breaks with American precedent, bucks antitrust law, and endangers American security.\n\nThe reality is that the technologies that are essential for securing the people and interests of the United States are overwhelmingly being developed in the private sector, which now accounts for about 75 percent of total U.S. research and development spending. Hamstringing these industries will make the nation less safe as the effects of years of insufficient national security funding, training and planning catch up with us and embolden authoritarian regimes in Beijing, Moscow and elsewhere.\n\nReversing these trends requires ongoing innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and robotics. But advancing these technologies is resource-intensive and decisively enabled by companies who are able to operate \"at scale.\"\n\nLast year, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft alone spent a combined $140 billion on research and development (R&D), not including acquisitions. The Pentagon's R&D budget for the same year was $109 billion.\n\nWhy were six U.S. companies able to outspend and out-innovate the U.S. government? Because they are profitable. And they are profitable because they are big.\n\nPushing the frontiers of science and pioneering game-changing technologies is expensive. The resources and talent to do these things are highly valuable and desperately scarce. It is no coincidence, then, that the companies that have found ways to attract billions of customers -- and the profits that come with them -- are the ones at the center of these innovations.\n\nInstead of railing against these companies because of their size, we instead should be thankful that our free-market economy has produced an alignment of interests where private-sector actors can generate wealth and jobs while also developing capabilities that will provide for the common defense. This uniquely American advantage may well be decisive in an era of escalating geopolitical competition. It would be reckless to give it away.\n\nThat is not to say that these companies should be legally immune simply for being important to national security. If a serious investigation demonstrates that any of these companies have violated antitrust, or any other law, by all means they should be held accountable.\n\nNor is it to deny other consequential issues related to these companies that still need to be addressed, such as their disproportionate power to bend public discourse, or their previous reticence to collaborate with the U.S. government (though all of the companies mentioned here are now actively pursuing U.S. defense contracts).\n\nTheir disturbing support of the People's Republic of China is particularly ripe for remediation: Microsoft's Beijing-based Research Asia Lab is the company's largest outside of the U.S. and is heralded as \"the single most important institution in the birth and growth of the Chinese AI ecosystem over the past two decades.\" Likewise, Apple's near-total capitulation to China's surveillance and data access demands justifiably invites public skepticism and congressional scrutiny.\n\nThese potent criticisms, however, do not justify blowing up an industry that constitutes 10.5 percent of our national GDP -- particularly when its innovations are at the heart of our current and future national security requirements.\n\nThe truth is that \"big\" is not bad. In fact, when it comes to tech, it may be a critical advantage.\n\nKlon Kitchen is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a former national security adviser to Sen.

                "title": "Why You Need A Custom eLearning Vendor - TodayHeadline",
                "body": "There has always been a challenge for organizations to match the organizational capabilities with emerging skillsets and technologies. This is especially true for the Learning and Development domain. Big organizations plan to recruit more people for each new skillset in their Learning and Development teams. But for organizations that cannot afford or do not want to recruit new specialized skills and roles in the learning domain, utilizing the services of a custom eLearning vendor is profitable and feasible.\n\nCustom eLearning refers to the tailor-made eLearning content, which is designed as per your requirement, and which helps enhance employee engagement and improve the overall business process in your organization. Generally, custom eLearning vendors will have multi-disciplinary teams that cater to the various needs of developing training content. You can take the help of these teams to develop eLearning solutions for your employees with quick turnaround times.\n\nThis article will discuss 4 reasons why you need a custom eLearning vendor for your training needs.\n\nLearning experience design refers to creating good eLearning courses by combining Instructional Design, visual design, knowledge of usability, and User Experience. It mainly focuses on how efficient and easy-to-use the learning content is. Learning experience design plays a pivotal role in the structure and delivery of an eLearning module or course.\n\nCustom eLearning vendors have expertise in learning experience design, including Instructional Design, learning and behavioral models, graphic design, motion graphics, and software development. They can develop a full-fledged eLearning course for your employees as per your training and design requirements. This is the primary reason why you need a custom eLearning vendor.\n\nResponsive eLearning design offers easy accessibility to learners across many devices that they use for learning. It allows the learners to start a course on a laptop, continue it on a tablet, and complete it on a smartphone. This is one of the primary reasons why companies want to invest in developing responsive eLearning content. Responsive eLearning design frameworks address the features supported by operating systems, browsers, and application platforms on different devices.\n\nResponsive eLearning design helps present the course content well-structured, thereby ensuring seamless flow in learning through the course. The learners will have an optimized experience and a smooth flow in their learning. Designing, developing, and deploying responsive eLearning modules and courses require proper execution of several architectures, frameworks, and tools like HTML5, CSS, Flash, Coding, etc. eLearning vendors are proficient in using these frameworks and tools. This is another significant reason why you need a custom eLearning vendor.\n\nCustom eLearning vendors design and develop immersive eLearning courses and modules based on your training needs. Immersive learning is a technique that uses a virtual world and/or Artificial Intelligence (AI) environment through which learners become fully immersed in the learning process. It can bring abstract learning scenarios to life, thereby providing a thrilling experience to the learners about the situations and problems in real life.\n\nImmersive learning incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). eLearning vendors will have the required proficiency and skills in these technologies. This is also another important reason why you need a custom eLearning vendor.\n\nIn the earlier days, it took months to develop an eLearning course. But now, with the help of rapid authoring tools, you can design, develop, and get the fully functional eLearning course in a few hours or days. In a rapid authoring tool, motion graphics, animated characters, slide transitions, ready-made templates, colorful infographics, smooth interactivities, audio/video recording plug-ins, assessment tools, and many other useful features are available in a single package.\n\nHowever, purchasing an authoring tool for your company is not cost-effective in order to develop a few courses or modules. For that, you can depend on custom eLearning vendors. They use the latest authoring tools and develop an eLearning course within your budget in a quick turnaround time. This is another crucial reason why you need a custom eLearning vendor.\n\nNo doubt, investing in eLearning content will undoubtedly add value to your employee training program. Engaging with a custom eLearning vendor and outsourcing your eLearning content requirements will definitely be a cost-effective solution. They will introduce you to new approaches and technologies and ensure your training becomes a success.\n\nAt Tesseract Learning, our learning and visual architects constantly innovate and reinvent their approaches to design, develop, and deliver effective eLearning courses and programs. We understand your needs and recommend the right strategy to create an impactful eLearning program for your employees.

Host, and the viewers an update about corporate ongoings and switching to using Etherium to cryptocurrency platform Polygon in the minting unique NFT.

Alain talks to viewers and updates the growing corporate fundamentals at GlobeX Data, Ltd. and its SekurSuite® cybersecurity products for large and small corporate end-users. Owning their proprietary platform, not using any open-source codes, and never selling mined data, Alain explains why the Company continues to grow its subscriber base. The Sekur product lines provide end-users with private texting and email for both the sender and the receiver. The uniqueness is that the receiver is protected even though not a subscriber to SWISF's services. Alain talks about the upcoming email web-based platform and the ease of the forthcoming downloadable application, which should be available by subscription soon, first Q1, 2022. The billboard ad displays the GlobeX Data's Sekur product on the NASDAQ building, the largest billboard in Time-Square, New York City, and other electronic billboards and media displays posted throughout New York City. Alain explains that, because of their sales and marketing campaigns, including these interviews on New to The Street T.V., the Company's revenues are up, the Company's stock price is up approximately 300% year to date, and the Company has over 2000 unique monthly subscribers. Forthcoming in 2022, GlobeX Data expects to launch a proprietary product based on the Sekur privacy platform as a competitive alternative to open-source ZOOM. He talks about the most recent \"HACK\" at Facebook, exposing over 3.8B users' data.

Talking with T.V. host Ann Berry, Alain enlightens the viewers with his \"WEEKLY HACK,\" giving another real-world problem with the commonly used internet, texting, and video conferencing platforms used by millions worldwide. This week, Alain talks about the \"HACK\" at Twitch, a gaming web portal. He explains that Twitch and its 3-party data partners did very little to secure the users' data, and it appears that a breach occurred on all users' PayPal information for the gaming fees. Alain goes on to explain the SekurSuite® and Sekur® products available for both individual and corporate uses. Alain recommends using at least 3 different email accounts with other priorities to minimize open-platform exposures. Calling them \"Trojan Horses,\" Alain tells viewers these nefarious operators pose themselves as friendly but want to hacking data and sell data on the \"Dark Web.\" Alain says using a Sekur email for your most private internet communications can eliminate that fear of being hacked. And, Sekur products operate through GlobeX Data's HeliX technological platform in Switzerland, having very tough privacy laws. Everyone remains at risk for a data breach when using open-source internet platforms and unsecured emails.\n\nThe New to The Street T.V. show airs the in-studio NASDAQ interview again with Mr. John Lai, CEO & President, PetVivo Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PETV). Talking with T.V.'s Host Jane King, Mr. Lai gives an overview of the Company's biomedical devices and its osteoarthritis treatment available to millions of dogs and horses.

Spryng™, classified as a biomedical device, helps reinforce the articulating cartilage barrier between the bones to protect the remaining cartilage and bone and improves joint function. With pet owners willing to spend thousands of dollars for the well-being of their pets, Mr. Lai explains the humanization process by pet owners and why he sees this upward trend continuing in pet care. Further, he highlights the use-of-proceeds of its capital raise and the Company's recent up-listing to the NASDAQ Market.\n\nAbout Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions (OTC:AITX)\n\nArtificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc.

                "title": "Researchers show Facebook's ad tools can target a single user",
                "body": "A new research paper written by a team of academics and computer scientists from Spain and Austria has demonstrated that it's possible to use Facebook's targeting tools to deliver an ad exclusively to a single individual if you know enough about the interests Facebook's platform assigns them.\n\nThe paper -- entitled Unique on Facebook: Formulation and Evidence of (Nano)targeting Individual Users with non-PII Data -- describes a \"data-driven model\" that defines a metric showing the probability a Facebook user can be uniquely identified based on interests attached to them by the ad platform.\n\nThe researchers demonstrate that they were able to use Facebook's Custom Audience tool to target a number of ads in such a way that each ad only reached a single, intended Facebook user.\n\nThe research raises fresh questions about potentially harmful uses of Facebook's ad targeting tools, and -- more broadly -- questions about the legality of the tech giant's personal data processing empire given that the information it collects on people can be used to uniquely identify individuals, picking them out of the crowd of others on its platform even purely based on their interests.\n\nThe findings could increase pressure on lawmakers to ban or phase out behavioral advertising -- which has been under attack for years, over concerns it poses a smorgasbord of individual and societal harms. And, at the least, the paper seems likely to drive calls for robust checks and balances on how such invasive tools can be used.\n\nThe findings also underscore the importance of independent research being able to interrogate algorithmic adtech -- and should increase pressure on platforms not to close down researchers' access.\n\n\"The results from our model reveal that the 4 rarest interests or 22 random interests from the interests set FB [Facebook] assigns to a user make them unique on FB with a 90% probability,\" write the researchers from Madrid's University Carlos III, the Graz University of Technology in Austria and the Spanish IT company, GTD System & Software Engineering, detailing one key finding -- that having a rare interest or lots of interests that Facebook knows about can make you easily identifiable on its platform, even among a sea of billions of other users.\n\n\"In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that addresses individuals' uniqueness considering a user base at the worldwide population's order of magnitude,\" they go on, referring to the scale inherent in Facebook's data mining of its 2.8BN+ active users (NB: the company also processes information about non-users, meaning its reach scales to even more Internet users than are active on Facebook).\n\nThe researchers suggest the paper presents the first evidence of \"the possibility of systematically exploiting the FB advertising platform to implement nanotargeting based on non-PII [interest-based] data\".\n\nThere have been earlier controversies over Facebook's ad platform being a conduit for one-to-one manipulative -- such as this 2019 Daily Dot article about a company called the Spinner which was selling a 'service' to sex-frustrated husbands to target psychologically manipulative messages at their wives and girlfriends. The suggestive, subliminally manipulative ads would pop up on the targets' Facebook and Instagram feeds.\n\nThe research paper also references an incident in UK political life, back in 2017, when Labour Party campaign chiefs apparently successfully used Facebook's Custom Audience ad-targeting tool to 'pull the wool' over former leader Jeremy Corbyn's eyes. But in that case the targeting was not just at Corbyn; it also reached his associates, and a few aligned journalists.\n\nWith this research the team demonstrates it's possible to use Facebook's Custom Audience tool to target ads at just one Facebook user -- a process they're referring to as \"nanotargeting\" (vs the current adtech 'standard' of microtargeting 'interest-based' advertising at groups of users).\n\n\"We run an experiment through 21 Facebook ad campaigns that target three of the authors of this paper to prove that, if an advertiser knows enough interests from a user, the Facebook Advertising Platform can be systematically exploited to deliver ads exclusively to a specific user,\" they write, adding that the paper provides \"the first empirical evidence\" that one-to-one/nanotargeting can be \"systematically implemented on FB by just knowing a random set of interests of the targeted user\".\n\nThe interest data they used for their analysis was collected from 2,390 Facebook users via a browser extension they created that the users had installed before January 2017.\n\nThe extension, called Data Valuation Tool for Facebook Users, parsed each user's Facebook ad preferences page to gather the interests assigned to them, as well as providing a real-time estimate about the revenue they generate for Facebook based on the ads they receive while browsing the platform.\n\nWhile the interest data was gathered before 2017, the researchers' experiments testing whether one-to-one targeting is possible through Facebook's ad platform took place last year.\n\n\"In particular, we have configured nanotargeting ad campaigns targeting three authors of this paper,\" they explain, discussing the results of their tests. \"We tested the results of our data-driven model by creating tailored audiences for each targeted author using combinations of 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 20, and 22 randomly selected interests from the list of interests FB had assigned them.\n\n\"In total, we ran 21 ad campaigns between October and November 2020 to demonstrate that nanotargeting is feasible today. Our experiment validates the results of our model, showing that if an attacker knows 18+ random interests from a user, they will be able to nanotarget them with a very high probability. In particular, 8 out of the 9 ad campaigns that used 18+ interests in our experiment successfully nanotargeted the chosen user.\"\n\nSo having 18 or more Facebook interests just got really interesting to anyone who wants to manipulate you.\n\nOne way to prevent one-to-one targeting would be if Facebook were to put a robust a limit on the minimum audience size.\n\nPer the paper, the adtech giant provides a \"Potential Reach\" value to advertisers using its Ads Campaign Manager tool if the potential audience size for a campaign is greater than 1,000 (or greater than 20, prior to 2018 when Facebook increased the limit).\n\nHowever the researchers found that Facebook does not actually prevent advertisers running a campaign targeting fewer users than those potential reach limits -- the platform just does not tell advertisers how many (or, well, few) people their messaging will reach.\n\nThey were able to demonstrate this by running multiple campaigns that successfully targeted a single Facebook user -- validating that the audience size for their ads was one by looking at data generated by Facebook's ad reporting tools (\"FB reported that only one user had been reached\"); having a log record in their web server generated by the (sole) user click on the ad; and -- in a third validation step -- they asked each nanotargeted user to collect a snapshot of the ad and its associated \"Why am I seeing this ad?\" option. Which they say matched their targeting parameters in the successfully nanotargeted cases.\n\n\"The main conclusions derived from our experiment are the following: (i) nanotargeting a user on FB is highly likely if an attacker can infer 18+ interests from the targeted user; (ii) nanotargeting is extremely cheap, and (iii) based on our experiments, 2/3 of the nanotargeted ads are expected to be delivered to the targeted user in less than 7 effective campaign hours,\" they add in a summary of the results.\n\nIn another section of the paper discussing countermeasures to prevent nanotargeting, the researchers argue that Facebook's claimed limits on audience size \"have been proven to be completely ineffective\" -- and assert that the tech giant's limit of 20 is \"not currently being applied\".\n\nThey also suggest there are workarounds for the limit of 100 that Facebook claims it applies to Custom Audiences (another targeting tool that involves advertisers uploading PII).\n\nFrom the paper:\n\n\"The most important countermeasure Facebook implements to prevent advertisers from targeting very narrow audiences are the limits imposed on the minimum number of users that can form an audience. However, those limits have been proven to be completely ineffective. On the one hand, Korolova et. al state that, motivated by the results of their paper, Facebook disallowed configuring audiences of size smaller than 20 using the Ads Campaign Manager. Our research shows that this limit is not currently being applied. On the other hand, FB enforces a minimum Custom Audience size of 100 users. As presented in Section 7.2.2, several works in the literature showed different ways to overcome this limit and implement nanotargeting ad campaigns using Custom Audiences.\n\nWhile the researchers refer throughout their paper to interest-based data as \"non-PII\" [aka, personally identifiable information] it is important to note that that framing is meaningless in a European legal context -- where the law, under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes a much broader view of personal data.\n\nPII is a more common term in the US -- which does not have comprehensive (federal) privacy legislation equivalent to the pan-EU GDPR.\n\nAdtech companies also typically prefer to refer to PII, given it's far more bounded a category vs all the information they actually process which can be used to identify and profile individuals to target them with ads.\n\nUnder the GDPR, personal data does not only include the obvious identifiers, like a person's name or email address (aka 'PII'), but can also encompass information that can be used -- indirectly -- to identify an individual, such as a person's location or indeed their interests.\n\nHere's the relevant chunk from the GDPR (Article 4(1)) [emphasis ours]:\n\n\"'personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\"\n\nOther research has also repeatedly -- over decades -- shown that re-identification of individuals is possible with, at times, just a handful of pieces of 'non-PII' information, such as credit card metadata or Netflix viewing habits.\n\nSo it should not surprise us that Facebook's vast people profiling, ad targeting empire, which continuously and pervasively mines Internet users' activity for interest-based signals (aka, personal data) to profile individuals for the purpose of targeting them with 'relevant' ads, has created a new attack vector for -- potentially -- manipulating almost anyone in the world if you know enough about them (and they have a Facebook account).\n\nBut that does not mean there are no legal problems here.\n\nIndeed, the legal basis that Facebook claims for processing people's personal data for ad targeting has been under challenge in the EU for years.\n\nThe tech giant used to claim that users consent to their personal data being used for ad targeting. However it does not offer a free, specific and informed choice to people over whether they want to be profiled for behavioral ads or just want to connect with their friends and family. (And free, specific and informed is the GDPR standard for consent.)\n\nIf you want to use Facebook you have to accept your information being used for ad targeting. This is what EU privacy campaigners have dubbed 'forced consent'. Aka, coercion, not consent.\n\nHowever, since the GDPR came into application (back in May 2018), Facebook has -- seemingly -- switched to claiming it's legally able to process Europeans' information for ads because users are actually in a contract with it to receive ads.\n\nA preliminary decision by Facebook's lead EU regulator, Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC), which was published earlier this week, has proposed to fine the company $36M for not being transparent enough about that silent switch.\n\nAnd while the DPC doesn't seem to have a problem with Facebook's ad contract claim, other European regulators disagree -- and are likely to object to Ireland's draft decision -- so the regulatory scrutiny over that particular Facebook GDPR complaint is ongoing and far from over.\n\nIf the tech giant is ultimately found to be bypassing EU law it could finally be forced to give users a free choice over whether their information can be used for ad targeting -- which would essentially blast an existential hole in its ad targeting empire, since even holding a few pieces of interest data is personal data, as this research underlines.\n\nFor now, though, the tech giant is using its customary tactic of denying there's anything to see here.\n\nIn a statement responding to the research, a Facebook spokesperson dismissed the paper -- claiming it is \"wrong about how our ad system works\".\n\nFacebook's statement goes on to try to divert attention from the researchers' core conclusions in an effort to minimize the significance of their findings -- with its spokesperson writing:\n\n\"This research is wrong about how our ad system works. The list of ads targeting interests we associate with a person are not accessible to advertisers, unless that person chooses to share them. Without that information or specific details that identify the person who saw an ad, the researchers' method would be useless to an advertiser attempting to break our rules.\"\n\nResponding to Facebook's rebuttal, one of the paper's authors -- Angel Cuevas -- described its argument as \"unfortunate\" -- saying the company should be deploying stronger countermeasures to prevent the risk of nanotargeting, rather than trying to claim there is no problem.\n\nIn the paper the researchers identify a number of harmful risks they say could be associated with nanotargeting -- such as psychological persuasion, user manipulation and blackmailing.\n\n\"It is surprising to find that Facebook is implicitly recognizing that nanotargeting is feasible and the only countermeasure is assuming advertisers are unable to infer users interests,\" Cuevas told TechCrunch.\n\n\"There are many ways interests could be inferred by advertisers. We did that in our paper with a browser plug-in (with explicit consent from users for research purposes). Even more, beyond interests there are other parameters (we did not use in our research) such as age, gender, city, zip code, etc.\n\n\"We think this is an unfortunate argument. We believe a player like Facebook can implement stronger countermeasures than assuming advertisers are unable to infer user interests to be later used to define audiences in the Facebook ads platform.\"\n\nOne might recall -- for example -- the 2018 Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal, where a developer that had access to Facebook's platform was able to extract data on millions of users, without most of the users' knowledge or consent -- via a quiz app.\n\nSo, as Cuevas says, it's not hard to envisage similarly opaque and underhand tactics being deployed by advertisers/attackers/agents to harvest Facebook users' interest data to try to manipulate specific individuals.\n\nIn the paper the researchers note that a few days after their nanotargeting experiment had ended Facebook shuttered the account they'd used to run the campaigns -- without explanation.\n\nThe tech giant did not respond to specific questions we put to it about the research, including why it closed the account -- and, if it did so because it had detected the nanotargeting issue, why it failed to prevent the ads running and targeting a single user in the first place.\n\nWhat might the wider implications be for Facebook's business as a result of this research?\n\nOne privacy researcher we spoke to suggested the research will certainly be useful for litigation -- which is growing in Europe, given the slow pace of privacy enforcement by EU regulators against Facebook specifically (and adtech more generally).\n\nAnother pointed out that the findings underline how Facebook has the ability to \"systematically re-identity\" users at scale -- \"while pretending it does not process 'personal data' on the data\" -- suggesting the tech giant has amassed enough data on enough people that it can, essentially, circumvent narrowly bounded legal restrictions that might seek to put limits on its processing of PII.\n\nSo regulators looking to put meaningful limits on harms that can flow from behavioral advertising will need to be wise to how Facebook's own algorithms can seek out and make use of proxies in the masses of data it holds and attaches to users -- and its likely line of associated argument that its processing therefore avoids any legal implications (a tactic Facebook has used on the issue of inferred sensitive interests, for example).\n\nAnother privacy watcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent privacy researcher and consultant, called the research staggering -- describing the paper as among the top ten most important privacy research results of this decade.\n\n\"Reaching 1 user out of 2.8bn? While the Facebook platform claimed there are precautions making such microtargeting impossible? So far, this is among the top 10 most important privacy research results in this decade,\" he told TechCrunch.\n\n\"It seems that users are identifiable by their interests in the meaning of article 4(1) of the GDPR, meaning that interests constitute personal data. The only caveat is that we are not certain how such a processing would scale [given the nanotesting was only tested on three users].\"\n\nOlejnik said the research shows the targeting is based on personal data -- and \"perhaps even special category data in the meaning of GDPR Article 9\".\n\n\"This would mean that the user's explicit consent is needed. Unless of course appropriate protections were made. But based on the paper we conclude that these, if present, are not sufficient,\" he added.\n\nAsked if he believes the research indicates a breach of the GDPR, Olejnik said: \"DPAs should investigate. No question about it,\" adding: \"Even if the matter may be technically challenging, building a case should take two days max.\"\n\nWe flagged the research to Facebook's lead DPA in Europe, the Irish DPC -- asking the privacy regulator whether it would investigate to determine if there had been a breach of the GDPR or not -- but at the time of writing it had not responded.\n\nOn the question of whether the paper strengthens the case for outlawing microtargeting, Olejnik argues that curbing the practice \"is the way forward\"- but says the question now is how to do that.\n\n\"I don't know if the current industry and political environment would be prepared for a total ban now. We should demand technical precautions, at the very least,\" he said. \"I mean, we were already told that these were in place but it appears this is not the case [in the case of nanotargeting on Facebook].\"\n\nOlejnik also suggested there could be changes coming down the pipe based on some of the ideas built into Google's Privacy Sandbox proposal -- which has, however, been stalled as a result of adtech complaints triggering competition scrutiny.\n\nAsked for his views on a ban on microtargeting, Cuevas told us: \"My personal position here is that we need to understand the tradeoff between privacy risks and economy (jobs, innovation, etc). Our research definitely shows that the adtech industry should understand that just thinking of PII information (email, phone, postal address, etc.) is not enough and they need to implement more strict measures regarding the way audiences can be defined.\n\n\"Saying that, we do not agree that microtargeting -- understood as the capacity of defining an audience with (at least) tens of thousands of users -- should be banned. There is a very important market behind microtargeting that creates many jobs and this is a very innovative sector that does interesting things that are not necessarily bad. Therefore, our position is limiting the potential of microtargeting to guarantee the privacy of the users.\"\n\n\"In the area of privacy we believe the open question that is not solved yet is the consent,\" he also said. \"The research community and the adtech ecosystem have to work (ideally together) to create an efficient solution that obtains the informed consent from users.\"\n\nZooming out, there are more legal requirements looming on the horizon for AI-driven tools in Europe.\n\nIncoming EU legislation for high risk applications of artificial intelligence -- which was proposed earlier this year -- has suggested a total ban on AI systems that deploy \"subliminal techniques beyond a person's consciousness in order to materially distort a person's behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm\".\n\nSo it's at least interesting to speculate whether Facebook's platform might face a ban under the EU's future AI Regulation -- unless the company puts proper safeguards in place that robustly prevent the risk of its ad tools being used to blackmail or psychologically manipulate individual users.\n\nFor now, though, it's lucrative business as usual for Facebook's eyeball targeting empire.\n\nAsked about plans for future research into the platform, Cuevas said the obvious next piece of work they want to do is to combine interests with other demographic information to see if nanotargeting is \"even easier\".\n\n\"I mean, it is very likely that an advertiser could can combine the age, gender, city (or zip code) of the user with a few interests to nanotarget a user,\" he suggested. \"We would like to understand how many of these parameters you need to combine. Inferring the gender, age, location and few interests from a user may be much easier than inferring few tens of interests.\"\n\nCuevas added that the nanotargeting paper has been accepted for presentation at the ACM Internet Measurement Conference next month.",

                "title": "The US has already lost to China, according to a former Pentagon chief",
                "body": "China has surpassed the United States in artificial intelligence, the key to leading global technological development and, consequently, positioning itself as a dominant power on the geopolitical stage. But what is surprising of all is that this statement does not come from the Asian country, but from a former Pentagon chief.\n\n\"We have no chance of competing against China in 15 or 20 years. At this moment, it is already a fact \", assures Nicolas Chaillan, who was director of software of the headquarters of the Department of Defense in Washington and resigned his position in protest due to the slow pace of the Army's technological transformation.\n\nChaillan believes that emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence are critical to the future of the United States. In that sense, he explains to Financial times that in today's interconnected world takes on a more relevant role than big-budget fifth-generation fighter jets like the F-35.\n\n\"Whether a war is needed or not is anecdotal,\" he says, referring to China being destined to become a dominant player without an armed confrontation, but rather controlling everything thanks to artificial intelligence. And, as if this were not enough, he assures that US cyber defense in some departments is at \"kindergarten level\".\n\nThe expert also acknowledges that part of the US slowness to react is due to the unwillingness of tech giants like Google to help with the Defense Department. On the contrary, he said to FT that in China, companies are obliged to work with Beijing, something that favors their advances in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe own evaluations of a national security commission Ordered by the Congress They predict that China, the world's second-largest economy, could dominate many of the key emerging technologies within about a decade. Among them is artificial intelligence, which is receiving a \"massive investment without regard for ethics\".\n\nFollowing his stint at the Department of Homeland Security, where he worked to modernize the cybersecurity system, Nicolas Chaillan became the Pentagon's first chief software officer. However, his criticisms of the military commanders and lack of advances in artificial intelligence did not take long to emerge.\n\nHe said that many of the officers in charge of cyber initiatives did not have the necessary experience. He denounced slowness and lack of funding. He also said that he spent a large part of the time \"fixing basic things in the cloud and laptopsInstead of innovating.\n\n\"We are building a critical infrastructure to fail,\" he said in his resignation letter. \"We wouldn't put a pilot in the cockpit without extensive flight training; Why would we expect someone with no IT experience to be close to success? (...) While we was wasting time in the bureaucracy, our adversaries advanced further, \"he added.",

                "title": "X-Men's Warrior Super-Mutant Comes to Life in Epic Body Paint Cosplay",
                "body": "Because Marvel's X-Men includes such a huge, diverse line-up of heroes, even the most obscure mutants tend to have die-hard fans, and that's certainly true for super-mutant chimera Rasputin, who inspired one body paint artist to create a cosplay so incredible, even the character's creator had to take note.\n\nRasputin was introduced in Powers of X #1, and comes from a defunct timeline where mutants were successfully wiped out by the rise of artificial intelligence. The series depicted the ninth life of Moira X, a mutant whose power is to repeatedly relive her own timeline in the style of Groundhog Day. Having seen mutants wiped out in every iteration of her life so far, Moira dedicated herself to discovering how they might survive, conscious of a prophecy that she was closing in on her final life. To that end, she spent her time gathering mutant leaders and informing them of the battle to come, leading to Mister Sinister's mutant cloning project, and the chimera known as Rasputin.\n\nChimeras are genetically designed to possess the powers of multiple mutants, and the comics imply Rasputin has the abilities of psychic rebel Kid Omega, steel-skinned Colossus, mutant phaser Kate Pryde, current Wolverine Laura Kinney, and classic villain Unus the Untouchable. While Rasputin dies in Powers of X #3, she's successful in obtaining the information Moira needs to try and save mutants one more time, and could one day be created again in the current timeline. Surprisingly, it turns out Sinister isn't the only person capable of creating Rasputin, as body paint artist Melissa Croft showcased her own version of the hero on Twitter, retweeted and praised by R.B. Silva (who responded, \"Awesome!!!!!!! I LOVED it!\") - the co-creator of Rasputin (along with writer Jonathan Hickman.)\n\nCroft nails Rasputin's organic steel skin, and depicts the character holding the Soulsword of Illyana Rasputin - Colossus' sister and the Sorcerer Supreme of Limbo. The weapon is capable of taking down even the Silver Surfer, and was constructed out of Illyana's life force, sometimes passed on to her brother and other heroes in Marvel's many potential futures. A warrior designed to meet the armies of the villainous Nimrod head on, Rasputin is one of mutantkind's most important heroes, even though few know her name - if her dark future is averted, it will only be because she fought tooth and nail to make it so.\n\nIt has to be any cosplayer's dream for a character's creator to express admiration for a costume, and the level of detail and contrasting materials created through the medium of body paint shows Croft's immense skill. Hopefully, Rasputin will eventually return to X-Men comics, as Melissa Croft's awesome cosplay proves that even mutants who only appear for a handful of issues can make a big impression.\n\nNext: X-Men: Mystique Transforms In One Of The Best Cosplays Ever\n\nSource: Melissa Croft\n\nShare Share Tweet Email 0 Comment Related Topics Comics News About The Author Robert Wood (304 Articles Published)\n\nRobert Wood is a comics editor for Screen Rant and the author of 'The False Elephant (and 99 Other Unreasonably Short Stories).'

(Nasdaq: GDYN) (\"Grid Dynamics\") company, has partnered with healthtech startup, selfologi, to launch a first of its kind, all-in-one online platform where cosmetic consumers can access trusted information about procedures, explore their local markets and book themselves professional treatments.\n\nAccording to Google search data, more than one million searches are made each month on aesthetic medicine treatments in the Middle East. Meanwhile, selfologi estimates that over $2.2 billion USD worth of cosmetic treatments are taking place across the region annually.\n\n\"Currently, almost all cosmetic treatments are booked offline, with consumers not having access to updated, regionally-relevant information that can aid their decision-making. When it comes to something as personal as cosmetic treatments and procedures, selfologi was born with the vision of offering an unparalleled platform that informs, educates, and helps consumers make the right choice for themselves, and realise their full potential,\" said Tamer Wali, Founder of selfologi.\n\nRob Pye, CEO of selfologi added: \"At selfologi, we aim to revolutionise the cosmetic and healthtech industry by providing a consumer-centric destination for cosmetic treatments and procedures. With support from the region's leading experts in aesthetic technologies, alongside some of the best digital brains in the business, selfologi is set to be a game-changer and a pioneer in the multi-billion-dollar cosmetic treatments industry.\"\n\nThis innovative selfologi business is built on an equally innovative Composable Commerce architecture, providing selfologi the flexibility to deploy best-in-breed technology and bespoke customer experiences crafted to meet the unique needs of their business. Tacit Knowledge and selfologi worked with partners commercetools, Amplience, Algolia to deploy the ecommerce platform, which plans to be fully transactional in the coming months.\n\n\"The composable approach has moved discussions with the business from 'platform A only allows this feature in this particular way' to 'this is how and when we can deliver this feature'. In selfologi's case, this approach allowed them to go to market early with a content rich non-transactional website while the teams continue working to add commerce capabilities as quickly as possible. New features will be available online as soon as they are ready. This is a business-changing, strategic advantage in today's fast changing market,\" said Maneesh Kumar, Director of Technical Consulting and Delivery at Tacit Knowledge.\n\nOn Wednesday October 20, 2021, Grid Dynamics and Tacit Knowledge are hosting a Webinar: Winning with Composable Commerce: Success Story. Rob Pye, CEO of selfologi, will share some insights and lessons learned from his Composable Commerce journey and joining Rob will be industry experts - Michael Scholz, Global Director, Head of Product Marketing at commercetools and Maneesh Kumar, Director of Technical Consulting and Delivery at Tacit Knowledge.

The billboard ad displays the GlobeX Data's Sekur product on the NASDAQ building, the largest billboard in Time-Square, New York City, and other electronic billboards and media displays posted throughout New York City.

Alain recommends using at least 3 different email accounts with other priorities to minimize open-platform exposures.

                "title": "Q&A: Enroute AI wants to build delivery's 'fingerprint of the city'",
                "body": "Neil Fernandes is founder of Enroute AI. Fernandes studied operations research during a graduate program in industrial engineering at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. During that time, he became interested in developing algorithms for transportation, which eventually led him to founding San Francisco, California-based Enroute AI. The company, which employs 10 people, powers approximately 50,000 deliveries every month and is releasing new features nearly every week.\n\nFernandes agreed to answer questions from Modern Shipper on Enroute AI and the last-mile routing segment. (Answers have been edited for style and brevity)\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Tell me a little about Enroute AI.\n\nFERNANDES. Enroute AI is a SaaS solution for simplifying last-mile logistics. At the core of our offering is a dynamic route optimization engine that uses AI to plan delivery routes that get even better with time. We provide our clients with a cloud-based dashboard for routing, real-time tracking, and dispatching. Enroute AI also includes intuitive iOS and Android apps for delivery drivers, proactive delivery notifications to end customers, and a robust API service for various integrations.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. How did the idea for Enroute AI come about?\n\nFERNANDES. The idea for Enroute came about when I was working as an analyst at a supply chain consulting firm run by an MIT professor. From the various projects that I had done, I realized that most companies were struggling with their last-mile operations, including the Fortune 500s who had access to state-of-the-art routing software. The software would plan routes that were not achieving the desired results in the real world. Almost none of the deliveries ended up being on time. The routes were being planned without considering traffic conditions, or the actual time it takes to make a delivery.\n\nWhile developing Enroute AI, I knew it had to be super easy to use and intuitive. I didn't want our customers to have to go through long implementation cycles, or significant training. In developing the product, I sat with dispatchers and rode on delivery trucks for months to see what exactly was causing delays and how we could build something that a driver and dispatcher could easily use.\n\nAs I started working with small and medium businesses, I realized that their struggles with last-mile deliveries were even worse than the bigger companies.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Can you tell me a little about Enroute AI's approach to last-mile logistics?\n\nFERNANDES. Our philosophy while planning delivery routes is to make them very close to reality. Our ultimate goal is to be able to plan routes such that our predicted ETAs for stops on the route are within a couple of minutes of the actual delivery. This means that we have to predict traffic better, understand infrastructure limitations like one-way streets and road closures, and allow room for last-minute surprises. We also have to be really good at estimating how long it actually takes to complete the delivery once the driver gets to the drop-off location. For example, a delivery to the front porch of a house in the suburbs might take a minute or two. However, a delivery to the 43rd floor at 500 Wall Street is going to take much longer.\n\nWe strongly believe that software should be easy and intuitive to use. Most last-mile software has a long implementation time and a steep learning curve. It's not built for drivers and dispatchers who are usually not technically savvy. Most last-mile software is built by software engineers with little to no real-world logistics background. However, we understand the nuances of the delivery workflow. We designed Enroute AI to be intuitive, easy to use, and to automate as many tasks for the drivers as possible.\n\nFinally, we built EnrouteAI to be dynamic and flexible. Exceptions happen every day in the last-mile world. We make it easy for dispatchers and drivers to respond to last-minute customer requests or disruptions in the schedule. This dynamic route optimization capability is a key differentiator for us.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. You've spoken with end customers, delivery drivers and supply chain professionals, what are their biggest pain points with current technology?\n\nFERNANDES. Each of these parties has specific pain points with current routing technology.Customers don't like it when they have to take time off work to receive a delivery and they are unsure of when it will actually arrive. Almost everyone we talked to prefers a late delivery with good visibility to an uninformed delivery where they are kept in the dark.\n\nI did not fully appreciate how hard a delivery driver's job is until I started riding along with them on delivery routes. They have to worry about a ton of things simultaneously: traffic, parking, finding the exact entrance to the building, knowing where to leave the package once they are inside the building etc. Their biggest pain point was that their existing routing technology was static and not responsive to real-world conditions leading them into areas of high traffic, going down roads that are closed to traffic, or asking them to make unsafe turns on busy roads. Other frustrating things for them were that it would route them to the leasing office of an apartment complex instead of the actual apartment, or the reception of an office building instead of the loading dock, which in rush hour downtown traffic could cost the driver half an hour. Also, most routing apps only work when a driver is connected to the internet. Their routing app stops working when they are downtown, inside high rises, basements, or in remote locations.\n\nShippers who operate their own fleet have trouble understanding the true cost of a delivery. Their routing software is not able to give them an estimate of how much a particular stop on the route costs them, which results in them losing money on some stops. One of our customers uses our software to decide which stops should be offloaded to a third-party carrier since we provide visibility into per stop costs.\n\nAnother pain point for our clients is visibility and billing issues when dealing with 3rd party carriers. Many of our clients use a mix of internal and external fleets for their deliveries. This combination helps them scale and expand to new geographies. However, their route planning software does not give them visibility into external carrier's deliveries. This lack of visibility costs them valuable customer support time when customers call support asking for ETAs. It also results in them overpaying their carrier for all the missed and late deliveries. We integrate with many carriers to solve the visibility issue.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Technology providers are always trying to solve for all possible conditions, but even the most robust and intelligent solutions run into real-world challenges. How has the Enroute AI technology been adapted to meet these ever-changing needs?\n\nFERNANDES. We realized pretty quickly that each customer's way of running their business is different. We did not want to be stuck with a platform that needs to be re-architected for each new customer or vertical market. Also, from a software perspective, things can get messy when maintaining multiple codebases for different customers. What we settled on is building a core that is common to all customers. Things like validating and geocoding addresses, optimizing the sequence of stops, notifications etc. Everything else is built as plugins (adaptors). This enables us to cater to each customer's unique needs.\n\nWe also know that software and AI can only get you 90% there, it can't account for every single eventuality that may happen when making pickups and deliveries. We try to mitigate some of that by making it very easy to modify routes by dragging and dropping markers on a map, to move stops between vehicles, automating notifications to the customers etc. All along our AI is learning and planning better routes with each delivery.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. You've mentioned that Enroute AI's artificial intelligence is able to capture small details such as which driveway is best to use when entering a location. How are you able to collect this type of granular data?\n\nFERNANDES. Yes, we gather and process a lot of data that captures the nuances of making a delivery. We call that our \"fingerprint of the city.\" We noticed that a driver who is familiar with a delivery location can complete a delivery in the fraction of time it takes a new driver. This is because the experienced driver knows the best place to park, which building entrance to take, and where specifically the package needs to be dropped off. None of the routing software I'm aware of captures this information. Making location insights available to drivers is a key factor in ensuring deliveries happen on time. For example, we work with a company making deliveries in Manhattan. They were using a routing solution that sent the driver to the Google address of the building which happens to be the front desk, instead of the loading dock. With one-way streets and rush-hour traffic, this can cause delays of up to half an hour.\n\nWe use multiple providers for location data; however, our biggest source of data is our mobile app for drivers. We constantly collect GPS pings from our mobile app for drivers and use machine learning to recognize patterns from that information. We are able to learn where the driver usually parks, what the traffic patterns look like in the neighborhood, where the exact entrance of the building is, etc. We are also experimenting with collecting WiFi and Bluetooth network information to improve location accuracy within buildings and dense urban environments where only relying on the GPS can sometimes show your location as being a block away.\n\nData is only half of the story; our secret sauce lies in processing this information to make sense out of it. If you only look at raw GPS pings in downtown for example, you might think that your driver is driving through buildings and flying across blocks. We need to filter out those outlier data points and only rely on points that make sense. When you deal with AI algorithms, garbage in equals garbage out. We spend a lot of effort making sure we feed our algorithms the right data.\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Last-mile drivers face any number of obstacles each day - traffic congestion, missed delivery windows, weather, etc. What approach does Enroute AI take with its solution to minimize disruptions due to real world, often unforeseen situations to ensure deliveries are made on time and drivers and vehicles remain efficient?\n\nFERNANDES. You're right, last-mile delivery is a hard job. As a delivery driver you deal with multiple unforeseen obstacles every single day. I still regularly ride along with delivery drivers during their daily routes. Every time they find something hard to do, I start thinking of ways that we can simplify the job for them.\n\nHere are a few things we do to minimize disruptions and make it easier on delivery drivers:\n\nMODERN SHIPPER. Last-mile delivery efficiency starts long before a package is loaded into a vehicle and requires coordination across a number of different departments and businesses. What obstacles exist to the integration of these disparate systems?\n\nFERNANDES. Yes, from the outside it's not apparent how many things have to come together to make an on-time delivery possible. It looks and sounds simple, until you start to understand all of the systems (ordering, billing etc.) involved. It's a very daunting and complex problem. There needs to be integration with many systems to ensure an efficient delivery. For example, we had to build an integration with a furniture company's e-commerce ordering system to make sure they were not promising customers a delivery on days when they had no capacity.\n\nThis problem also extends downstream into the billing systems as well. Making sure that payments are made according to the contract is pretty daunting: fuel surcharges, waiting times, premium for white-glove services etc. Billing was such a big pain point for our clients that we started integrating our software into their billing system to process rules on the rate card automatically (time, distance, number of packages, fuel surcharge, etc.).\n\nThe biggest problem we face is that many carriers and shippers run on legacy platforms that have an integration layer (they don't support API integration). Getting data in and out of these systems involves a convoluted process of exporting data from their system and importing them into our system. This process often requires manual intervention and can be error prone. We also encounter clients who use TMSs and order management systems that support integrations, but these systems lock down that functionality to thwart competition.\n\nWhat makes integration even more confusing, is that we deal with carriers and shippers using different terminology for the same process, depending on their industry. Even within the same industry carriers and shippers use different terminology. For example, some shippers refer to white glove service as premium service, whereas some carriers refer to it as special deliveries. As a result, we can't build a one size fits all integration. We need to customize the integration depending on the shipper and carrier combination, which can be pretty daunting.\n\nOur approach to deal with complexity of integration is by architecting our software to be flexible and extensible. As mentioned earlier we have core functionality that is common to all our clients. All the customizations and one-off integrations are built as plugins (adaptors). When we notice that the plugin is used by enough people, we integrate that into our core functionality.",

We'll look at why the gaming and data center businesses can continue growing, while also looking at potential risks standing in Nvidia's way.\n\nAt this time in 2016, Nvidia was just getting started in applying its core graphics-processing technology to the booming data center market. Since then, Nvidia's data center revenue has grown from 10% of its business to 36%, yet its core business of selling GPUs to gamers hasn't taken a back seat. The gaming segment generated $10.5 billion in revenue over the last four quarters, or 48% of the company's business, with gaming revenue up 85% year over year in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nMore people started gaming during the pandemic, which expanded the market for gaming hardware. The gaming GPU market should grow at a compound annual rate of 14% through 2026, according to Mordor Intelligence. If Nvidia's gaming segment grows at that rate, it could nearly double to almost $20 billion in annual revenue in five years.\n\nNvidia commands a dominant lead in gaming hardware, with an 83% market share of the discrete GPU market. It's also seeing growth with its GeForce Now cloud gaming service. Overall, growing interest in esports and the launch of more games taking advantage of the latest graphics technologies should encourage more upgrades for Nvidia's gaming GPUs for a long time.\n\nThese trends have already fueled a compound annual growth rate of 19.2% for the company's gaming business over the last three years.\n\nThe data center opportunity is even more promising and should grow to become Nvidia's largest segment by 2025. Its data center business generated $8.2 billion in revenue over the last four quarters, but management has estimated the addressable market at $100 billion. Nvidia has plenty of avenues to tackle this opportunity.\n\nIts A100 chip has seen strong adoption for artificial intelligence use, including powering natural language processing and recommendation engines. Nvidia offers GPUs, data processing units (DPUs), and in the next few years its first data-center CPU, which could significantly expand its growth opportunity.\n\nMoreover, its acquisition of Mellanox a few years ago positions Nvidia to be a top supplier for networking hardware, which is sort of the nuts and bolts of the server market.\n\nBeyond server hardware, Nvidia is now starting to launch software platforms that allow organizations to have all the tools they need to maintain top-level security for their servers, but at the same time provide sophisticated software for data scientists to use AI to design new applications. Nvidia sees software services built on its core GPU technology as another multibillion-dollar opportunity.\n\nWhat's more, if Nvidia gets through the regulatory approval process and lands Arm Holdings from SoftBank Group, that would just add many more billions of potential revenue to the company's already large addressable market. Arm would open other growth opportunities for Nvidia in Internet of Things and mobile devices. The long-term upside would be absolutely massive.\n\nIt's very possible that Nvidia could double in value by 2025, but it's also impossible to know what the state of the economy will be at the time, and whether investors will have the appetite to pay a high P/E to buy the stock.\n\nA recession or industrywide slowdown would slow Nvidia's revenue growth, potentially causing the stock to fall. Sometimes these slowdowns in the semiconductor industry can come unexpectedly, as it did in late 2018 when Nvidia's share price dropped 52% in the fourth quarter that year.\n\nIn the near term, there is also possible downside risk for the stock if the Arm deal doesn't get approved. On the other hand, some analysts are placing a low probability of the deal happening, so there may not be any downside related to the pending Arm deal, but it's still something to keep in mind if you're buying the stock.\n\nWith that said, Nvidia's leadership in GPU technology puts it at the center of the burgeoning AI economy, with its expanding offering of hardware and software products. In my view, the odds are favorable that Nvidia can reach a market cap of $1 trillion by 2025.",

                "body": "Store No8 incubator unit pilots conversational commerce technology with customers\n\nWalmart has begun piloting technology to allow busy consumers to text the retailer products they want to purchase.\n\nDominique Essig, vice president of conversational commerce for Walmart's Store No8 incubation arm, said in a blog post Thursday that her unit and the retailer's global technology team have launched a beta test of Walmart Text to Shop in selected markets. With the solution, customers can send Walmart text messages naming products to add to their shopping list or virtual cart on Walmart.com or in the Walmart mobile app.\n\nRelated: Walmart, Meredith look to make food media content 'shoppable'\n\n\"We're learning a lot about when and how customers prefer a conversational experience, and we look forward to making this more widely available in the future,\" Essig said.\n\nWalmart Text to Shop builds on the Bentonville, Ark.-based retail giant's multiyear efforts to enable voice commerce, including through partnerships with Google via the Google Assistant and Alexa virtual assistant and with Apple via its Siri virtual assistant.\n\nRelated: Walmart enlists artificial intelligence for online grocery substitutions\n\n\"Walmart gets it, and we're here to make the shopping process simple and convenient,\" according to Essig. \"This type of innovative customer experience is exactly what we build every day. And while Walmart has offered voice shopping for years, text shopping is just getting warmed up.\"\n\n'Text shopping is just getting warmed up,' said Dominique Essig, VP of conversational commerce at Walmart.\n\nToday's on-the-go consumers often conjure up a \"mental grocery list\" while performing other tasks, such as driving the kids to school, and voice and text functionality enable them to add needed items along the way, noted Essig.\n\n\"We're doing laundry and remembering it's our turn to bring snacks to soccer practice. We're doctoring a kid's boo-boo and realizing we're almost out of Band-Aids,\" she explained. \"Soon, our supermom will simply be able to say, 'OK, Google, add Band-Aids to my Walmart cart.' Whether she's using a Google or Apple device, commands like this one open the Walmart app and add Band-Aids -- the superhero Band-Aids Walmart knows are the household favorite -- to her cart, and she doesn't have to lift a finger.\n\nSo how close are customers to being able to text Walmart their shopping list? I'm excited to say that Store No8 and Walmart's Global Tech team are currently testing a beta experience, Walmart Text to Shop, with customers in select areas.\"\n\nIn a video with Rebecca Nathenson, director of product management for Google Assistant developer platform at Google, Essig cited the growth potential of conversational commerce, led by voice. By 2030, 30% of e-commerce sales are expected be driven by voice shopping, she said.\n\n\"Food was really the last frontier in 2020 in e-commerce. We saw tremendous growth and families going online to purchase the items that they need. So I'm incredibly excited about voice commerce and how it can help families,\" Essig said in the Google VOICE Talks video. \"I think there's tremendous opportunity here to help customers.\"\n\nPersonalization also is a linchpin of voice and text commerce, Essig wrote in her blog. By understanding customers' preferences when they shop, Walmart can save them time by serving up \"what we know they love best\" in terms of favorite or regularly purchased items, she explained.\n\n\"Most importantly, we offer Walmart customers the opportunity to shop no matter where they are and to communicate naturally by simply asking for what they want, any way they want,\" Essig said. \"The advantage of conversational commerce is that customers can communicate with Walmart the way they communicate with friends and family: easy, convenient -- no need to learn how to use a new platform. Let's face it, we'll [consumers will] never stop trying to do a million things at once. Our hope is that conversational commerce can help ease the stress of the never-ending to-do list.\"",

                "title": "Invoking 'Big Tech' as an accusation can endanger American security",
                "body": "Could Congress's antitrust campaign against Big Tech derail America's strategic competition with China? A bipartisan collection of senior national security leaders -- including a former Secretary of Defense, former Director of National Intelligence, former CIA executives, and a former White House Homeland Security adviser -- think so, and we would do well to listen.\n\nIn a letter written to Congress last month, this diverse group of notables warned that \"more deliberate analysis is needed to examine the detrimental impact\" that a slew of proposed antitrust laws targeting Big Tech could have on American power.\n\nTheir misgivings are well-founded: One of these proposals, for example, would amend legislation on anti-competitive monopolies such that any company with a market cap of more than $100 billion would be prevented from making any merger or acquisition.\n\nThough this particular proposal thankfully has not gained much traction, it is representative of the kinds of poorly considered, far-reaching bills that should have us all concerned. For their proponents, the term \"Big Tech\" is often invoked as an accusation, implying that the scale of these companies alone means they need to be broken up. This approach breaks with American precedent, bucks antitrust law, and endangers American security.\n\nThe reality is that the technologies that are essential for securing the people and interests of the United States are overwhelmingly being developed in the private sector, which now accounts for about 75 percent of total U.S. research and development spending. Hamstringing these industries will make the nation less safe as the effects of years of insufficient national security funding, training and planning catch up with us and embolden authoritarian regimes in Beijing, Moscow and elsewhere.\n\nReversing these trends requires ongoing innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and robotics. But advancing these technologies is resource-intensive and decisively enabled by companies who are able to operate \"at scale.\"\n\nLast year, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft alone spent a combined $140 billion on research and development (R&D), not including acquisitions. The Pentagon's R&D budget for the same year was $109 billion.\n\nWhy were six U.S. companies able to outspend and out-innovate the U.S. government? Because they are profitable. And they are profitable because they are big.\n\nPushing the frontiers of science and pioneering game-changing technologies is expensive. The resources and talent to do these things are highly valuable and desperately scarce. It is no coincidence, then, that the companies that have found ways to attract billions of customers -- and the profits that come with them -- are the ones at the center of these innovations.\n\nInstead of railing against these companies because of their size, we instead should be thankful that our free-market economy has produced an alignment of interests where private-sector actors can generate wealth and jobs while also developing capabilities that will provide for the common defense. This uniquely American advantage may well be decisive in an era of escalating geopolitical competition. It would be reckless to give it away.\n\nThat is not to say that these companies should be legally immune simply for being important to national security. If a serious investigation demonstrates that any of these companies have violated antitrust, or any other law, by all means they should be held accountable.\n\nNor is it to deny other consequential issues related to these companies that still need to be addressed, such as their disproportionate power to bend public discourse, or their previous reticence to collaborate with the U.S. government (though all of the companies mentioned here are now actively pursuing U.S. defense contracts).\n\nTheir disturbing support of the People's Republic of China is particularly ripe for remediation: Microsoft's Beijing-based Research Asia Lab is the company's largest outside of the U.S. and is heralded as \"the single most important institution in the birth and growth of the Chinese AI ecosystem over the past two decades.\" Likewise, Apple's near-total capitulation to China's surveillance and data access demands justifiably invites public skepticism and congressional scrutiny.\n\nThese potent criticisms, however, do not justify blowing up an industry that constitutes 10.5 percent of our national GDP -- particularly when its innovations are at the heart of our current and future national security requirements.\n\nThe truth is that \"big\" is not bad. In fact, when it comes to tech, it may be a critical advantage.",

The others are health care, retail, manufacturing, sustainability and nonprofits. Microsoft announced the newest industry cloud, Cloud for Sustainability, at its Inspire conference in July.\n\nAlthough financial institutions exist in a highly regulated environment, just like health care, Cloud for Financial Services holds the potential of helping partners start serving financial services as a new vertical or expand on existing offerings aimed at financial institutions, Borden said.\n\n\"Now a partner can actually get to scale with these types of capabilities by building and using our entire technology stack to actually enrich their value proposition to their customers,\" he said.\n\nJohn Weston, senior vice president of the global Microsoft practice for Boston-based Microsoft Gold Partner Publicis Sapient, told CRN in an interview that he's been working with Microsoft's cloud for financial institutions.\n\nHe said the package acts as a new interface for financial institutions that want to use new, cloud-based tools with their legacy systems. The collaboration applications included in the package, for example, can help speed up internal communication and the process for executing loans.\n\nWeston doesn't think the package will lead to more competition for Publicis Sapient when it comes to financial institutions, calling the regulations and complexity around mortgages and other financial processes difficult to overcome for an unfamiliar partner.\n\nBut for Microsoft to be successful with its industry clouds, it will need to rely on its partner ecosystem, Weston said.\n\n\"For Microsoft to be successful in deploying these, they're gonna need a partner like us to go out there and help set it up,\" he said.\n\nNavy Federal Credit Union and Virgin Money UK are among the first financial institutions to preview Cloud for Financial Services, according to a Microsoft blog post earlier this month.\n\nCloud for Financial Services pulls from Microsoft Azure, 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform and comes with multi-layered security and compliance and trust commitments built in, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe cloud package's capabilities include a unified customer profile showing financial, behavioral and demographic data. A customer onboarding feature aims to simplify loan applications and loan processing. The banking customer engagement feature aims to create personalized interactions and reduce customer churn and the time needed to resolve issues. And the collaboration manager feature automates front and back office tasks to improve communications with customers, according to Microsoft.\n\nCloud for Financial Services' financial crime combating features include an account protection feature to protect against bot attacks, account takeover and fraudulent account access. The purchase protection feature aims to protect merchants from online fraud with advanced adaptive artificial intelligence, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe cloud package also has a risk assurance and support feature, providing a dedicated team of engineering subject matter experts for internal and external risk, audit and compliance needs. And the regulatory compliance assessments feature aims to help organizations manage compliance, implement controls, report to auditors and keep track of certifications, according to Microsoft.\n\nAlong with Publicis Sapient, the other service partners working with Cloud for Financial Services include Accenture, Avanade, Avtex, Capgemini, EY, KPMG and PwC. Independent software partners working on third-party products and services for the cloud package include Backbase, BaseCap, Finastra, Mortgage365, VeriPark and Zafin, according to Microsoft.\n\nAlong with the general availability of Cloud for Financial Services, new tools in Cloud for Nonprofits become generally available in November, according to Microsoft. Volunteer engagement, volunteer management and security and compliance enhancements will become available next month.\n\nThis month, Cloud for Healthcare, which was already generally available, gained new capabilities including improved modeling of health care data in dataverse, better linking of patients and expansion of Dynamics- and Power Platform-based solutions in Europe and Asia.\n\nIn February, Microsoft will release public previews of new Cloud for Healthcare features, including the ability for providers to see unified patient profiles and patient activity timelines plus improving the speed of using care management features.",

                "title": "Flight of the Concord Drones",
                "body": "The City Council of Concord, California, is tone deaf to community concerns regarding a proposed police Unmanned Aerial Surveillance (UAS) system - commonly referred to as drones. In a city where the police department is responsible for nearly 60% of the city budget, this should come as no surprise. The UAS program, however, will strangely be funded by Marathon Petroleum, which has no offices or facilities in Concord. EFF, ACLU, and 15 other Contra Costa community organizations opposed this action. We also demanded police oversight and ample safeguards to protect civil liberties and civil rights if the program were to be adopted.\n\nPrivacy and police accountability are a massive issue with UAS systems, and are both high priority issues for California voters, as evidenced by the passage of California Consumer Privacy Act and police accountability legislation.\n\nDrones are unmanned aerial vehicles that can be equipped with high definition, live-feed video cameras, thermal infrared video cameras, heat sensors, and radar -- all of which allow for sophisticated and persistent surveillance. Drones can record video or still images in daylight or at night (with infrared lenses). They can also be equipped with software tools like license plate readers, face recognition, and GPS trackers that extend the dangers they pose to privacy. There have even been proposals for law enforcement to attach lethal and non-lethal weapons to drones. Additionally, newly developed drone automation allows for automatic tracking of vehicles and individuals.\n\nEFF and our allies sent a letter urging the Concord City Council to not adopt a UAS system for Concord Police Department. If, however, the city council decided to approve the UAS system, we made specific recommendations to provide ample safeguards to protect civil liberties and civil rights:\n\nFirst, drones should be deployed only with a warrant, or in an emergency that threatens death or serious bodily injury to a person. All deployments should be thoroughly documented, and that documentation must be made publicly available.\n\nSecond, facial recognition technology, artificial intelligence, automated tracking, heat sensors, license plate readers, cell-phone interception, and lethal and non-lethal weapons should be prohibited as incorporated technologies to UAS drones.\n\nThird, there must be clear rules regarding access to UAS footage. Officers suspected of misconduct must not be allowed to view footage until they have made an initial statement regarding the episode. People depicted in footage must have access to the footage. Also, footage depicting police use of force must be available to the public. Similar to the flaws in body worn cameras, police can exercise too much control over the video before the public sees it without police oversight.\n\nMore generally, Concord should adopt a Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) ordinance. A CCOPS law acts to promote transparency, the public's welfare, civil rights, and civil liberties in all decisions regarding the funding, acquisition, and deployment of surveillance equipment by local police. Such a law would appropriately require city departments to provide the public with information about surveillance proposals, including a draft usage policy, weeks rather than days before the proposals are debated before the City Council.\n\nNot only did the Concord City Council approve the police drones, it also failed to adopt these meaningful safeguards. Concord, like many other municipalities, decided instead to use a boilerplate, unprotective Lexipol policy. Will Concord become the next Chula Vista, which deploys a drone for nearly every 911 call? Only time will tell. Concord's drone policy is permissive enough that it could be.",

                "body": "There is a marked difference between viewing and interacting with the world as a third-party spectator, and experiencing the action intimately from a first-person point of view.\n\nThis difference is similar to watching others ride a roller coaster, from the ground, as opposed to riding the roller coaster yourself - what ultimately ends up informing the experience and understanding of the roller coaster ride, is entirely disparate.\n\nThis is the current obstacle facing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications for use.\n\nTo unlock the next wave of AI technology that will power future assistants and innovations for Augmented Reality (AR) and robotics, AI needs to evolve to an entirely new paradigm of egocentric (i.e. first-person) perception. This means teaching AI to understand the world through human eyes in the context of real-time motion, interaction, and multi-sensory observations.\n\nTo do so, a consortium has been formed by the National University of Singapore (NUS) and 12 other universities around the worldto undertake an ambitious, long-term project, called Egocentric 4D Live Perception (Ego4D).\n\nA team from the NUS Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering has been actively working to collect first-person data, specifically in Singapore. This data was collected over the course of 2021, via head-mounted cameras and AR glasses distributed to a total of 40 participants locally. This allowed the NUS team to capture their eye-level, first-person, unscripted experiences of day-to-day scenarios: routine activities such as getting a haircut, dining at a hawker centre, or going to the gym. Based on the collected video data, the NUS researchers were then able to train AI models to understand people and their interactions by leveraging both audio and visual cues.\n\nAssistant Professor Mike Shou, who leads the NUS research team, said, \"Over the past 10 years, we have witnessed the revolution of AI for image understanding, which is built on the foundations laid down by datasets like the ImageNet. Similarly, I believe our Ego4D dataset will lay down the necessary groundwork for egocentric video research, and spur remarkable progress in building AI models for AR and robot applications.\"\n\nImproving AI technology for smart and useful assistants\n\nThe current paradigm of computer vision (CV) has, so far, excelled at understanding what is in an image or video by learning from vast amounts of online photos and videos from a third-person view, where the camera is a spectator from afar.\n\nAdvancements in first-person, or egocentric perception, will provide the fundamental building blocks necessary to develop smarter cognitive capabilities for AI assistants in the context of the person interacting with it. Such AI assistants will prove more useful in our day-to-day lives and work. Imagine: when trying to cook a new recipe, instead of referring repeatedly to a cookbook and attempting to multi-task, simply wearing a pair of AR smart glasses can direct you to perform each specific step, as you are doing it.",

                "title": "Minneapolis Schools' 'Gaggle' Software On Kids' Devices Reports 'Gay', 'LGBTQ' Users As It Blocks Porn, Finds At-Risk Of Self Harm - Towleroad Gay News",
                "body": "Minneapolis Public Schools are using software to monitor student communications in and out of school, raising serious concerns over student privacy, according to the non-profit The 74 ,that has analyzed public records and just issued a report that raises serious concerns related to the use of the Gaggle software that can be used for 24-hour monitoring through school-provided tech devices, and includes Identifying and passing along student interest in keywords including \"gay\", \"LGBTQ\" and others.\n\n\"It suggests that anything you write or say or do in school -- or out of school -- may be found and held against you and used in ways that you had not envisioned,\" Jennifer Mathis, director of policy and legal advocacy at The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, told The 74.\n\nGaggle uses \"artificial intelligence' techniques to analyze students' emails, chat messages, documents, personal files and media looking for words and terms that its dictionary of terms indicates they are at risk or potentially broaching a concerning topic. If a term is identified, a human moderator is notified and evaluates the flagged content before deciding to pass it along to school officials or not.\n\nThis process is endorsed by Gaggle CEO and founder Jeff Patterson as a way of helping endangered minors. \"As a parent you have no idea what's going on in your head, but if you don't know you can't help them, and I would always want to err on trying to identify kids who need help,\" Patterson said.\n\nBut the theory behind Gaggle's program may not exactly line up when put into action. An analysis of 1300 records from Minneapolis Public Schools showed that Gaggle system identified numerous uses of terms related to pornography, suicide and violence by students, including some from journal entries, classroom assignments and fictional stories. But Gaggle's software isn't able to filter those terms for context.\n\nThis resulted in school-assigned projects discussing mental health, short stories submitted to a school literary magazine and private discussions on cartoon porn between students being flagged and sent along to school officials. In the case of trans eighth-grade student Teeth Logsdon-Wallace, they told a reporter that this process re-traumatized him after overcoming severe depression and suicidal ideation triggered by remote learning last year.\n\nIn fact it was Logsdon-Wallace writing about overcoming those issues, his suicide attempt and the role music played in his recovery for a classroom assignment, that Gaggle's system flagged and notified school officials. When those officials contacted his mother, Logsdon-Wallace said he felt some betrayal.\n\n\"I was trying to be vulnerable with this teacher and be like, 'Hey, here's a thing that is important to me because you asked,\" Logsdon-Wallace told The Guardian. \"Now, when I've made it clear that I'm a lot better, the school is contacting my counselor and is freaking out.\"\n\nThe study by The 74 found that Gaggle's system is likely to disproportionately affect LGBTQ students. Three dozen records show that Gaggle flagged terms concerning LGBTQ identities, including the words \"gay\" and \"lesbian.\"\n\n\"When people are just talking about being gay, anything they're writing would be flagged,\" Logsdon-Wallace explained. \"They have 'gay' flagged to stop people from looking at porn, but one, that is going to be mostly targeting people who are looking for gay porn and two, it's going to be a false positive because they are acting as if the word gay is inherently sexual.\"\n\nAccording to a Minneapolis school newspaper, Gaggle's inclusion of LGBTQ terms in its library of questionable terms led to at least one instance where an LGBTQ student was outed to their parents by school officials.\n\nGaggle maintains that its service saves lives, though its claim that Gaggle did so for 1,400 minors during the 2020-21 school year have not undergone any form of independent verification. The company experienced growth of more than 20% in 2020 after a number of school systems implemented the program during remote learning.\n\nThe 74's study found that roughly a quarter of flagged incidents reported to school officials happened when students would be on school grounds, but in spite of the fact that a majority of reports were generated at home, Minneapolis school officials deny that students' privacy is undermined by its use of Gaggle tied to school-issued accounts and devices.\n\nThat \"privacy tax\" on those who economically are more reliant on a school supplied device means that low-income students are more likely to be surveilled along with the LGBTQ ones, simply because a school-supplied device is more likely to be their only device for personal as well as academic work. This in turn increases their likelihood of interfacing with the justice system which has been shown to increase the likelihood of being further disproportionately surveilled through adult hood\n\n\"That's definitely really messed up, especially when the school is like, 'Oh, no, no,no, please keep these Chromebooks over the summer,\" Logsdon-Wallace Said.",

Almost all network partners were able to attend the 2.5-hour event and exchanged ideas on current and potential projects. The focus here was on getting to know each other as well as targeted networking. With the help of a modern network platform, the participants were encouraged to exchange ideas in virtual chat rooms about the topics of digitization and artificial intelligence, new materials for restoring or healing tissue and organs and new approaches to stem cell therapy.\n\nThe next network meeting is planned for the beginning of December 2021. The network partners largely determine the focus of the next meeting themselves; Depending on requirements, either a cross-network workshop or a lecture on a specific topic from the field of regenerative medicine is prepared.\n\nAbout SmartMed:\n\nThe international ZIM cooperation network \"Regenerative Solutions for Tomorrow's Therapy\" is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy as part of the ZIM program (Central Innovation Program for SMEs). The network management of Silversky LifeSciences GmbH launched the association with technological competencies from blockchain to the regulation of medical devices at the beginning of July 2021. Networking is coordinated by Silversky LifeSciences with its business start-up experts with a technology focus in LifeSciences and with extensive experience in the financing, operation, and development of innovative small and medium-sized companies in this sector. \"Each partner brings a certain specialist knowledge and thus a unique contribution to the value chain into the network\", describes Dr. Mirko Stange, founder, and CEO of Silversky LifeSciences, the win-win situation for everyone involved.\n\nThe international focus is on UK, which also offers German network partners a good opportunity to react to the new framework conditions, especially after Brexit and the associated reorganization of international cooperation. The project is supported by the international network management team Maria Fenner, Lena Ehrenpreis and Jessica Stolzenberg. \"The aim of the network is to network companies with R&D institutions in order to initiate a lively innovation policy, to promote startups and to promote the exchange and cooperation of regenerative medicine with related industries\", says Jessica Stolzenberg. \"We want to give all SMEs and startups in the industry the opportunity to expand their network and find new cooperation partners. If there is still funding for my own research activities, I don't know who would turn it down,\" says Lena Ehrenpreis. Maria Fenner adds: \"Our focus is on the entire field of regenerative medicine and the development of innovative, regenerative therapies, which are based on the latest scientific findings and use the most modern technologies. The focus is on restoring the healthy and functional original state of the affected tissue / organ by linking modern therapeutic approaches, new and functional materials, as well as the use of digital and intelligent systems in the form of algorithms, deep learning and AI. \"\n\nThe support provided by the network includes advice and practical help with the market launch, applying for grants, close collaboration between experts in order to research or optimize new therapy methods and to bring products to market maturity.
