Be a Part of Ambient Intelligence;Tue Nov 16 11:43:00 UTC 2021;Bob Mars;"Ambient intelligence is an environment where each of your devices and services is interconnected through artificial intelligence (AI), offering far more capabilities than any single service or device could. In this paradigm, AI understands the state of your environment and your preferences, helps you when you need it, and recedes into the background when you don't. Imagine a smart picture frame that shows you your personal schedule as you approach it, interacts with a third-party weather service to proactively make a suggestion for what to wear, and reverts to artwork as you walk away.
Amazon is just one of many companies investing in ambient intelligence. We're making it easier for developers and partners to build devices and services that integrate deeply with our products. We believe that a truly ambient environment will include many different technologies and voice AIs working together, seamlessly, in a customer's household. Amazon understands that developing ambient environments requires support and knowledge from the entire industry — so we sponsored the Voice Interoperability Initiative to support and accelerate voice AIs working together.
In a world with multiple voice services, each with different capabilities, we believe customers should have the freedom to choose their preferred service. To this end, Amazon, along with leading technology companies, announced the Voice Interoperability Initiative (VII) just over two years ago. VII now has over 90 members committed to providing customers choice and flexibility to interact with multiple voice services. Our aim is to deliver this experience through simultaneously available voice services, each with their own ‘wake word’ or invocation name that enable customers to talk to the service of their choice by simply saying its name.
Bringing together many different technologies and having voice services working together in ambient environments introduces new challenges for product and voice agent designers. To understand how simultaneously available voice services can work together on the same product, Amazon published a Multi-Agent Design Guide (MADG) with the input of VII members. The MADG provides design recommendations and best practices for delivering delightful customer experiences with multi-agent devices.
The MADG paves the way to natural voice interactions with agents. For example, it should be clear to customers which agent is listening so they can direct the question they are asking or command to the intended agent. Also, when a user is in a conversation with one agent, interruptions from other agents should be limited, much the same way we limit interruptions when we engage in human conversations. The MADG covers these topics and also introduces new concepts such as Universal Device Commands (UDCs) and Agent Transfers.
UDCs allow a person to ask any agent on a device to perform certain functions, such as stopping music playback, which is helpful when it is unclear which agent was initially asked to play music because the person who started the music has since left the room. An Agent Transfer redirects to another agent on the device when a user asks an agent to perform a task that it cannot fulfill. In this case, the agent automatically initiates a dialog with another agent that may be able to fulfill the task. UDCs and Agent Transfers improve the customer experience in ambient environments by helping accomplish what the customer wants when multiple voice agents are involved.
Amazon has recently announced two new technologies that support agent interoperability on a single product that are consistent with the principles outlined in the Multi-Agent Design Guide: Alexa Custom Assistant (ACA) and the Multi-Agent eXperience (MAX) Toolkit.
ACA is a comprehensive new solution built directly on top of Alexa technology that lets device makers and service providers create intelligent assistants tailored to their brand personality and customer needs. It provides companies with access to world class, always-improving voice AI technology, customized with a unique wake word, voice, skills, and capabilities. The brand's assistant also seamlessly coexists and cooperates with Alexa, providing customers the benefit of an intelligent assistant that is their product and services expert, while Alexa provides the familiar experiences they already know and love.
MAX Toolkit includes an agent-agnostic MAX Library middleware that enables your agent and cloud services to coordinate and interoperate with other agents. MAX models conversations between people and agents in much the same way that people engage in conversations with one another. It also provides methods for coordinating potential simultaneous speech output by multiple agents. For example, if the user has asked an agent to remind them of something later in the day and that reminder is about to occur while another agent is speaking, the reminder speech can be queued to be output after the speaking agent finishes.
Both ACA and MAX facilitate the integration of multiple agents on products in ambient environments. Use ACA to host your brand agent if you do not have a voice agent infrastructure. Or consider MAX Toolkit to integrate your agent and its cloud services alongside other agents and Alexa on your product.
Today, customers can interact with Alexa and other agents on a number of devices, including Facebook's Portal devices and Deutsche Telekom's Smart Speaker Mini. There are also devices from Orange, Xiaomi, OnePlus and more as well as in vehicles from Audi, BMW, VW, and Nissan where voice agents co-exist. That's the beauty of ambient intelligence done right — it enables developers to bring together different solutions into a unified, delightful customer experience.
In the coming years, a large number of homes and work places will have ambient intelligence that will be able to learn about your environment and preferences and act on those insights in ways that are useful to you. Ambient environments consist of many different technologies and voice agents that work together seamlessly on, and across, devices. VII, MADG, ACA and MAX Toolkit are making it easier for developers and partners to build devices and voice services that work well together in serving customer needs.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2021/11/be-a-part-of-ambient-intelligence;
Launch of Smart Home Device Health Service;Mon Nov 08 13:02:00 UTC 2021;Sharon Morrow;"Do you want to use Smart Home technology to help customers resolve device issues like connectivity? Today we are pleased to announce “Smart Home Device Health Service (SHDHS)”, a first step on our journey to support customers as they purchase and use a wide variety of Smart Home devices. Smart Home Device Health Service is a free service that monitors the status of Smart Home devices and, if an issue is detected, guides customers through the troubleshooting process. With Device Health Service, customers can solve device issues themselves, giving them more time to enjoy the convenience of Smart Home technology.

Device Health Service analyzes device health to detect network connectivity issues, notifies the customer, then suggests ways to reconnect the device. For example, if a device is disconnected from a Wi-Fi network, Device Health Service will send a notification to the customer and provide device-specific troubleshooting steps as shown in the images below. If these do not resolve the problem, the Alexa App will guide the customer to the right customer support tools for further assistance.
In this first release, we are launching support for LIFX, Sengled, and TP-Link KASA lights. In 2022, we plan to expand Device Health Service support to other devices that provide device health status, including many products with the Certified for Humans badge.
To add the benefits of Device Health Service to your device, just implement the Alexa.EndpointHealth interface in your Alexa skill! This will enable your device to report its connectivity status to Alexa.

Alexa is Coming to Hospitals and Senior Living Communities to Improve Care Experience and Help Fight Loneliness;Mon Oct 25 08:15:00 UTC 2021;Shantanu Kurhekar;"Today, we are excited to announce two new solutions as part of Alexa Smart Properties that will enable senior living and healthcare providers to integrate Alexa into their properties and empower residents and patients to stay connected, informed and entertained, just by asking Alexa. These two solutions take another step toward our vision for Alexa and ambient technology to foster connection and help make our customers’ lives better — inside and outside of the home.
With Alexa Smart Properties in senior living communities, we aim to reduce loneliness for senior residents by enabling interactions with friends and family via Alexa, and enable a more connected environment that enables residents to communicate with staff, participate in property activities, and stay engaged with their community, by just asking Alexa. With Alexa Smart Properties in healthcare systems, we aim to improve the care experience for patients and care providers, enabling healthcare providers to communicate with patients quickly and easily with features like calling and Drop In—without the need to enter patient rooms. This enables hospitals to increase productivity, conserve medical supplies and protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and gowns, and frees up staff time to provide more personalized care. Healthcare properties can also enable HIPAA-eligible skills to connect care providers with residents and patients in an environment designed to protect their health information. Additionally, both solutions include the Alexa capabilities customers know and love, such as in-room smart device control, entertainment, and access to information. Solution providers will have access to Alexa Management APIs and Alexa Management Console, so they can grow their business quickly by automating set up and management of Alexa on a large number of devices, and offering a wider variety of features and devices to their customers. Our early adopters share their experience in this post.
Over the last several years, social interactions in the world have undergone a significant change, and the impact of COVID-19 has further underlined this impact. Senior living communities have been hit hard, and senior residents report finding it challenging to stay in touch with their loved ones. With Alexa Smart Properties, we enable permissions-managed, two-way audio and video calling, so that senior residents can connect with friends and family often. Moreover, friends and family can check in with senior residents through inbound calling. Senior residents can stay more connected with their community by asking Alexa for the menu of the day, by joining bingo night on video, or by connecting with other residents on an Alexa call.
The healthcare systems have been under a lot of stress lately. With Alexa Smart Properties, we enable care staff such as nurses and doctors to care for patients more efficiently. Customer testimonials from early adopters indicate that Alexa has helped hospitals streamline care process, save on costly personal protection equipment (PPE) and increase staff safety by reducing the number of in-person interactions required between care staff and patients, helping to curb infection risk.
Alexa Smart Properties senior living and healthcare solutions were designed with privacy in mind. No personal information is shared with Alexa to use the device, and voice recordings are not saved. Every Amazon Echo device offers multiple layers of privacy protection, and residents and patients can disable Alexa’s ability to hear and respond to the wake word at any time simply by pressing the mute button on top of their Echo device. Amazon implements administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for protected health information received as part of HIPAA-eligible skill interactions.
Todd Carling, Director of Business Development, Fellowship Square Mesa Community says “When we started using Alexa three years ago, our senior residents were hesitant about using technology. By adopting voice technology into our community, our residents have found more independence in their daily living. We also found that we are attracting younger residents, and the average age of our residents has decreased by two and one-half years. With baby boomers entering senior living communities, they are expecting to have technology in their lives. Communities will either flourish with technology or become stagnant without technology.”
Matt Smith, CEO of Speak2Software, says ""What we do impacts people's lives. We create ways for people to connect, we deliver positive human emotions. We literally couldn't do that without our partnership with Alexa Smart Properties. They provide the tools and services for us to build our software on, but more importantly, they provide the guidance, support, and leadership we need to be successful and to bring those tears of joy to our customers.""
Craig Anderson, Director of Innovation at Baycare, says, “One of the things we like about Alexa voice technology is that it lets our care team save steps while keeping them closer to our patients. The patient can simply ask Alexa for things they need like a blanket or a glass of water. Alexa interprets all those requests and sends it to right person. It is a seamless connection between the patient and their care team.”
Timothy Driscoll, Director of Technology Strategy at Boston Children’s Hospital, says, “Boston Children's Hospital is using Amazon Echo devices to provide an array of features to patients including entertainment in the form of music and games, hospital and unit-specific frequently-asked questions, and control of the in-room televisions. Our patients will soon be able to express their needs for things like pain management support - ""Alexa, tell my nurse I'm in pain,"" or general comfort - ""Alexa, tell my nurse I need a pillow."" Using AI for the interpretation of patient intent will enable the direction of messages to the appropriate resource using real-time smart routing to existing hospital communication systems. Ultimately this will reduce the number of steps taken to understand and address patient needs.”

Introducing the New Alexa Connect Kit SDK for Smart Home Devices ;Wed Oct 20 11:11:00 UTC 2021;Nithya Chandrasekaran;"Today, we are excited to announce Alexa Connect Kit SDK (ACK SDK), a software package that enables Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) and System Integrators (SIs) to build their own ACK-based modules and differentiated Alexa-compatible smart device solutions without having to worry about managing cloud services, building an app, or writing an Alexa skill. Since the launch of Alexa Connect Kit in 2019, dozens of leading consumer product brands have used ACK Modules to build Alexa-compatible products ranging from lighting products to fans, air purifiers, coffee makers, microwaves, and even Christmas trees.
This new SDK enables you to build your own Alexa-compatible solutions with the same benefits as ACK, and with more control over costs and features. ODMs and SI solution providers such as Leedarson, Tonly, Innotech, and Linkplay are developing solutions with ACK SDK on Espressif hardware, and leading device makers like Globe Electric and Jasco are creating devices utilizing ACK SDK based solutions.  

“Our consumer demand is moving so quickly, and our product margins are thin; with this new ACK SDK, we are able to build a low-cost module that meets the thermal, size, and cost requirements for smart home devices like lighting products, switches, dimmer switches, plugs, and air purifiers. All of this is possible without compromising the set-up experience or the convenience of lifetime device management enabled by ACK. We value the flexibility, hardware and cost optimization options that the new ACK SDK provides for our scale,” said Kellen Yang, Global VP of Sales & Marketing, LEEDARSON IoT Technology Inc.
You can prototype your product using ACK SDK, and design your hardware module with an Amazon-qualified SoC for mass manufacturing. ACK SDK uses the same connectivity and device management software components from Amazon Common Software that many of our Amazon devices use today. You can choose the level of customization for your device, and implement simple applications with just a few managed callbacks and APIs. ACK SDK comes pre-integrated with components for Alexa control (Smart Home Skill APIs), Frustration Free Setup, security, log and metric collection, and firmware updates – managed by Amazon. Further, since ACK SDK is available as source code, it allows you to customize even more, such as fine-tuning power profiles by taking advantage of the SoCs low-power modes and having better control over peripherals. Example applications included with ACK SDK, as well as the device-side test suite for different device types, help developers catch programming errors and troubleshoot issues during prototyping. The development experience is supported by a set of robust program guidelines and certification processes to enable building secure and high-quality connected device solutions.
With the new ACK SDK, solution providers can now build device solutions to fit their design, manufacturing, and cost needs, while leveraging the ACK managed cloud. This new SDK works with any Amazon-qualified SoC, or you can apply to bring your own SoC. Additionally, unlike the existing ACK Modules which are designed to run the device application on a MCU separate from the connectivity module, ACK SDK allows you to run the device application on the same hardware module, enabling single-chip designs that open up lower cost use cases.
Solutions built with ACK SDK are backed by the ACK managed cloud service, built on AWS IoT, and benefit from using the same secure and reliable infrastructure Amazon leverages for its own products.
“We’re excited to leverage the ACK SDK through Amazon’s Solution Providers to develop a whole suite of low-cost products such as LED smart bulbs and smart lighting controls, which we weren’t previously able to enable with ACK,” said Mitchell Davis, VP of Connected Home at Jasco. “We appreciate the reliability and security of ACK’s managed cloud and infrastructure, and are excited to extend it to more products in our portfolio using this technology.”
Customers love their ACK devices because these devices offer the benefits of the Smart Home Skill API, as well as Frustration Free Setup, and Amazon Dash Replenishment. Plus, the ACK managed cloud service is built on AWS IoT, so ACK-built devices will automatically meet the cloud service reliability requirements necessary for Works with Alexa (WWA) and Certified for Humans (CFH) certifications, subject to the testing and other requirements set forth in the program guidelines for WWA and CFH. After your device is certified, you can feature the WWA or CFH badges in the Amazon Smart Home Store and on product packaging, opening new marketing opportunities and increasing customer confidence that your devices work seamlessly with Alexa.
Amazon is working with silicon vendors to grow the selection of ACK SDK compatible hardware for ODMs and SIs to choose from. 

 “We are pleased to be part of the ACK SDK program, and excited to partner with Amazon to announce our first ACK SDK-compatible development kit. Espressif’s ACK SDK-compatible development kit is going to make it even easier for solution providers and device makers to use our products to build innovative connected-devices using the best-in-class ACK SDK,” says Espressif's Director of Technical Marketing, Mr. Amey Inamdar.

Alexa Smart Properties for Hospitality Launches in the UK;Wed Oct 13 11:35:00 UTC 2021;Alvaro Sahun Pacheco;"Today we are excited to announce the launch of Alexa Smart Properties for Hospitality in the UK. From today, solution providers and UK properties can start integrating Alexa’s world-class AI into valuable end-to-end experiences at scale. Alexa Smart Properties simplifies tasks for guests like playing music, ordering room service, calling the front desk and even checking out.
Mercure Hotels, part of Accor, will introduce the new Alexa experience across select properties in collaboration with Hotel Cloud. You can check out the experience at Mercure Hyde Park Hotel, a 72 room luxury hotel in central London, today!
Using Alexa in their room, guests can control and adjust compatible in-room devices such as lights, thermostats and blinds, or play music from popular services. Many exciting Alexa Smart Properties features — such as music and smart home controls — are available out-of-the-box, though hospitality providers may also choose to develop custom skills to further personalise their guests experience. For example, guests can ask Alexa for information like the Wi-Fi password or fitness centre location, request hotel services like housekeeping (“Alexa, I need towels”), call the concierge, and more.
Additionally, hoteliers and property managers have the option to enable skills from the Alexa Skills Store on the devices they manage so that their customers can check airport wait times, play games, get a quick guided workout, play sleep sounds to help them fall asleep, and more. Alexa’s Skill selection includes popular skills like Audible Stories, BBC News, BBC Sounds, Sleep Sounds, and many more. 
Guest’s use of Alexa in their room is optional, Echo smart speakers have a Microphone Off button that electronically disconnects the microphone. With Alexa for Hospitality, guests use Alexa without connecting their Amazon account to the Alexa enabled device and voice recordings are not saved. For more information on privacy visit www.amazon.co.uk/alexahospitality/guest.
Mercure Hyde Park

Introducing Smart Home Device Status Announcements;Tue Aug 31 12:53:00 UTC 2021;Manisha Talwar;"Today, we are excited to share that Alexa can now make device status announcements for Smart Home devices that use Alexa.RangeController,  Alexa.ModeController or Alexa.Cooking interfaces. Developers can simply implement the new Alexa.ProactiveNotificationSource interface and leverage ChangeReport events, to send device status announcements such as “Your washer is done"", “Your robotic vacuum is stuck”, or “Your oven has preheated” to customers.  Leveraging this new capability, developers can have Alexa  engage  customers in the most natural way - using voice - to inform them of  task progress on their smart home devices. This is made possible by simplifying the process for developers with standardized templates that require no guesswork on messaging, resulting in a consistent customer experience across devices and partners. The interface for developers provides multiple properties across many comprehensive states which can detect events and provide a scalable way of extending device status announcements. More states will be added over time so developers can extend device status announcements. 

With device status announcements, manufacturers can alert customers when their Smart Home device needs attention or inform them of task progress, differentiating their products. Manufacturers such as GE Appliances, iRobot, Eufy, Anova, and Samsung are the first to implement device status announcements to make their Alexa-connected devices proactive and helpful to customers.
Manufacturers such as iRobot are using the new interface to proactively alert their customers of any anomalies while they perform their tasks. “Announcements for Smart Home Devices via Alexa enable us to deliver more value to our customers,” says Chris Jones, CTO, iRobot. “We can let customers know when their Roomba robot vacuum or Braava jet robot mop needs assistance and help the customer take an action when they need to. We see this as another step in giving customers greater control over when, where, and how their robots clean, ensuring the job gets done right so customers can focus on more important things.”
Manufacturers such as GE are implementing the new interface to inform their customers of task progress across a broad range of devices. “With Announcements, Alexa can notify customers when their washers, dryers, and ovens have completed the task.” says Shawn Stover, VP Smart Home Solutions, GE Appliances. “It’s a unique experience that supplements the mobile notifications we deliver today, and reaffirms the value of our connected devices.” 
Manufacturers like Anova are also implementing the new interface to inform their customers of cooking progress. “At Anova, our mission is to make our products accessible, simple and connected in a meaningful way to our food nerd community,"" says Anastasia Plotnikova, Director of Marketing at Anova Culinary. ""Food nerds can now receive announcements of cooking progress on a connected Anova Precision Oven with Alexa when their oven has preheated, the food has reached the target temperature and even that their food is ready, making it easier than ever to get pro-level results at home.""
With this new feature, you don’t have to worry about crafting individual device status announcements. Amazon provides pre-built templates to easily construct the right device status announcement. You can specify the list of notifiable properties and the property value for which you want Alexa to make an announcement, such as “Your <instance friendly name> is <state>”.  Today, states like  “Low”, “Empty”, “Full”, “Done”, and “Stuck”, are supported for a variety of devices such as vacuums, washers, and dryers. Specifically for cooking appliances, announcements support different states with Alexa.CookingStatus, which can take values such as, “PREHEATING_COMPLETED”, “FOOD_TARGET_TEMPERATURE_REACHED”, “COOKING_COMPLETED”, and “READY“. Here, Alexa can make an announcement such as,“Your <appliance friendly name> is ready to use” with pre-defined templates.
To get started, you can implement the ProactiveNotificationSource interface for your device in your discovery response. When you use ChangeReport to report a change to a property, it triggers device status announcements supported by ProactiveNotificationSource.
To enable device status announcements for devices using Alexa.RangeController  or Alexa.ModeController interfaces, indicate the Alexa states that your device supports.  Here you include a semantics object with stateMappings field in the appropriate controller instance in your discovery response.  When you configure the ProactiveNotificationSource interface you simply specify the list of notifiable properties for your device and the corresponding states these properties should reach in order for an announcement to be sent.  For example, to notify customers when their washer is done, you would include a notification condition for Alexa.ModeController.mode property with the value Alexa.States.Done. Then, whenever you send a change report for an updated mode value corresponding to Alexa.States.Done, Alexa knows to notify your customer with a device status announcement.
Similarly, for cooking devices that use the Alexa.Cooking interface, to enable device status announcements, indicate the cooking statuses that your device supports by including the property Alexa.Cooking.supportedCookingStatuses in your discovery response. When you configure the ProactiveNotificationSource interface you simply specify the list of notifiable cooking statuses for your device in order for an announcement to be sent.  For example, to notify customers that their food is ready, you would include a notification condition for “COOKING_COMPLETED”. Then, whenever you send a change report for a cookingStatus value corresponding to ""COOKING_COMPLETED"", Alexa knows to notify your customer with a device status announcement.
Join leading brands in enabling device status announcements for your customers! You can start integrating your compatible devices to support this feature today by viewing the documentation below.

Amazon Builds on Multi-Agent Vision as Verizon Leverages Alexa Custom Assistant Technology      ;Wed Aug 18 16:11:00 UTC 2021;Tracy Allen;"Voice technology has started delivering truly ambient experiences, where a customer isn’t tethered to a single device or even a single voice service. While we’re always thinking about how to innovate and improve Alexa, we see a world with plenty of room for other voice services to succeed. We believe there will be many winners in ambient technology - that the world will evolve to have many voice assistants, each with unique strengths and competencies.  To provide choice and flexibility, makers of voice-enabled devices can create multi-agent experiences that allow customers to have the option to use whichever voice assistant(s) they prefer simultaneously – this way, customers can choose the assistant that provides the capabilities they want in ways best suited to their individual needs. We think that’s a win all around.
    
Nearly two years ago, Amazon, along with leading technology companies, announced the Voice Interoperability Initiative (VII) which is committed to providing customers choice and flexibility to interact with multiple voice services simultaneously. The program now has almost 90 members working towards this vision.
Verizon, who was among the first 30 members to join Amazon in the VII, will soon be launching the Verizon Smart Display that leverages the recently announced Alexa Custom Assistant technology. The display will give Verizon customers more flexibility to oversee their broadband options. By using “Hi Verizon,” they can set up their service and manage their account. And with Alexa Custom Assistant, the Verizon Smart Display not only responds to “Hi Verizon” to manage their Verizon services, it also provides access to Alexa and all the great services that are integrated with it.  This smart display is a prime example of how device makers and developers are working from the customer backwards, and innovating to deliver voice experiences that are delightful, and solving real customer challenges.
The Verizon Smart Display, with Alexa Built-in, leveraged Alexa Custom Assistant, a comprehensive solution that makes it easy for any brand to create their own custom voice assistant built on Alexa technology, with a unique wake word, voice, personality, and capabilities when creating the Verizon Assistant.    
Amazon previously announced global automaker Stellantis as the launch customer for ACA, and has continued momentum since then with Qualcomm, Garmin, and Elektrobit and Continental announcing the first integration of ACA on a production vehicle. These suppliers and systems integrators serve a vital role enabling OEMs to build with Alexa technology like the are Alexa Custom Assistant and reducing the burden of long development times.
Partners are choosing to reduce the burden and cost of building their own voice assistant from the ground-up in favor of leveraging Alexa’s technology. With the Alexa Custom Assistant, partners can take advantage of Alexa technology, based on the latest understanding of spoken language and the AI-driven approach to conversational experiences, to create intelligent assistants tailored to their brand personality and customer needs.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/08/verizon-leverages-alexa-custom-assistant-technology;

We’re announcing APL Widgets, available in Developer Preview. Widgets are a new way for customers to interact with content from the home screen of their device, including rich, customizable, glanceable, self-updating views of skill content. With Widgets, interactive skill experiences are available to customers even before they invoke your skill. For example, imagine a customer being able to “check an item off a list” or tap a widget to be taken straight to the latest content your skill has to offer. You can use APL documents to create these Widgets just as you would with your multimodal skill responses today.  Apply for the preview here.  
 
FEATURED SKILL CARDS
The Echo Show home screen already shows customers things like news, recipes, photos and more. Soon, select developers will be able to use Featured Skill Cards to promote their skills in the home screen rotation. Customers will be able to discover and interact with your skill right from the Home screen – so you can acquire and engage with customers. Whether you’re a large brand, or individual developer with high quality skills, promotion on the home screen provides a meaningful opportunity to increase discovery, and deepen engagement. You can apply now to participate in the limited Developer Preview.

NAME FREE INTERACTION TOOLKIT EXPANSION
Last year, we announced the Name Free Interaction, or NFI Toolkit, which enables you to provide Alexa with signals about common requests that your skill can handle, making it easier for customers to find and use it without having to remember your skill’s name. Adopting the NFI Container has shown to be a key tool to boost traffic. While results can vary from skill to skill, we saw some double their traffic when using NFI. We’re now expanding availability of the NFI Toolkit in all English locales and adding three new capabilities on top of this framework:
 

SKILL DISCOVERY VIA POPULAR PHRASES
 Today, there are millions of discovery-oriented utterances per month from Alexa customers. Things like “Alexa, tell me a story”, “Alexa, I need a workout”, or ""Alexa, let’s play a game.” Now, you can have your skill suggested as one of Alexa’s responses to these popular discovery phrases via voice and on screen. This is a new way to acquire customers with highly relevant, real-time skill suggestions. You can apply for the preview today.


PERSONALIZED SKILL SUGGESTIONS
 We also want to make it easy for customers to keep using skills they love. We have added personalized skill suggestions to Name Free Interactions. This includes new skill affinity models and customer feedback mechanisms. These are designed to make it easier for you to connect with customers that have shown interest in your skill – or similar skills. For example, a customer could ask “Alexa how did the Nasdaq do today?” and Alexa will help route them by offering your skill with a prompt like “You’ve previously used the CNBC skill. Would you like to use it again? Apply for the preview today.


CONTEXTUAL SKILL EXPERIENCES
 We have also extended Name Free interactions to support contextual discovery of skills through multi-skill experiences. Customers can use natural phrases to accomplish tasks across multiple skills to meet the desired goal. Customers don’t have to invoke each skill separately or repeat the same information when talking to different skills. For example, when users ask Alexa what happened today in history, Alexa will respond, and then ask them if they would like to search for talks on history in the TED Talks skill. Alexa will then automatically pass the search topic “history” and deep link the customers into the skill. Apply for the preview here.
PAID SKILLS
Today we’re introducing Paid Skills, a new form of monetization that you can leverage. With Paid Skills, customers pay a one-time fee, up front, to access the content in your skill. This is ideal for premium skills where a customer is more likely to pay once, to access the core skill experience. You’ll be able to start building Paid Skills in the coming weeks.
 
IN-SKILL PURCHASING EXPANSION
We are also expanding in-skill purchasing capabilities internationally to India and Canada later this year.

ALEXA SHOPPING ACTIONS
Alexa Shopping Actions (like ‘Add to Cart’ or ‘Buy’) enable you to sell products from Amazon.com within your skill. For example, Starfinder, a science fiction role-playing game on Alexa, will use Alexa Shopping Actions to allow customers to purchase their table-top board game.
Alexa Shopping Actions are simple to use and integrate into your skill experience. And of course, it leverages the same security features that customers are using today to shop on Alexa. Apply for the preview here.
AMAZON ASSOCIATES ON ALEXA

While you can use Alexa Shopping Actions as a stand-alone feature in your skill, we are also excited to bring one of the largest affiliate marketing programs in the world, Amazon Associates, to Alexa.
You can choose from millions of products available on Amazon.com to recommend within your skill using Shopping Actions and earn a commission on qualifying product referrals. Consistent with the Amazon Associates program, you can earn a commission of up to 10% when a customer purchases the recommended product. You can apply now to participate in the limited Developer Preview.
AMAZON MUSIC SPOTLIGHT FEATURE
With the new Spotlight feature on Amazon Music, artists can now connect directly with fans by uploading an existing message recording or creating one in the Amazon Music for Artists mobile app. With Spotlight, artists can promote new music and even shine a light on their creative process. Fans can immediately listen on Alexa or in the Amazon Music app, from artist profile pages.
SHARED ACTIVITIES API
We want games to be more social. Later this year, we are making the Shared Activities API available. You will be able to use the Shared Activities API to build asynchronous Multiplayer Challenges to make sharing games with friends possible. This unlocks new ways for customers to play with friends and family. Imagine challenging friends to try and beat their score in Jeopardy. You can apply now to participate in the limited Developer Preview.

INTERACTIVE MEDIA SKILL COMPONENTS + SONG REQUEST SKILL COMPONENT
Since the start of this year, customers have used Alexa-enabled devices to listen to billions of hours of music, radio, and podcasts. To continue to make Alexa more delightful for customers, we’re pleased to announce Interactive Media Skill Components, which will shorten the time it takes for Radio, Podcast & Music providers to launch interactive experiences on Alexa. And we are launching the developer preview of the Song Request Skill Component. Radio DJs can engage with listeners by taking song requests & dedications via Alexa. Apply for the preview here.
FOOD SKILL APIs
Today we’re announcing Food Skill APIs enabling you to quickly create high-quality, food delivery and pickup experiences. Using these Food Skill APIs, you can build easy-to-use, high-accuracy customer experiences with improved discovery features.
Part of getting a customer’s attention is having the right offer, in the right place, and of course at the right time. That’s why leading restaurants like Domino’s will be launching new discovery experiences on Alexa using these APIs. Food Skill APIs also include new ways to surface offers to customers when they ask Alexa for food options.

EVENT-BASED TRIGGERS + PROACTIVE SUGGESTIONS
We’re announcing two more features to build ambient experiences – Event-Based Triggers and Proactive Suggestions. Using Event-Based Triggers and Proactive Suggestions, you can build proactive experiences for customers at home and on the go. For example, if a customer is heading out for work, customers could opt in to have a skill proactively suggest that they lock their home. Additionally, if a customer begins their morning run, a skill could suggest a playlist to listen to. Whole Foods is using these features for a curbside pickup experience that will launch later this year.
Both Event-Based Triggers and Proactive Suggestions will be available for developers later this year.
CUSTOM TASKS IN ROUTINES
Customers use Alexa Routines to simplify their everyday lives. Routines can help automate and bundle daily actions like “Alexa, start my day” or “Alexa, Good night” or “Alexa, (let’s) chill out.” In fact, the percentage of Alexa customers using Routines has more than doubled since last year. Now, with Custom Tasks in Routines, a customer can customize routines to take them directly to what they love about your skill. For example, a customer could make a Routine for “Alexa, what's happening today?” that takes them straight to Quotes, Business News, or Market Updates within their favorite News skill. You can apply now to participate in the limited Developer Preview.

SEND TO PHONE
With Send to Phone, customers can start an experience on their Alexa-enabled device, and continue it on their mobile phone.  With the combination of Quick Links and Send to Phone, you can build ambient experiences that make use of both Alexa and mobile.
McDonald’s UK worked with Vixen Labs to create a skill using Send to Phone that makes grabbing a great deal even easier. Customers can use the My McDonald’s skill to find nearest restaurant, how to get there and the latest deals, and Alexa will send a notification to their phone with the deal information deep-linked to the My McDonalds’s app. Other brands like Twitter, Husqvarna, Iberia Airlines, Cookpad, and Lysol will also be using Send to Phone to couple their mobile app with their Alexa skill.
FIND MY
Alexa now has the capability to help customers find the things they care about the most. With today’s launch, available first in private beta, you can use the newly available Find My APIs to create Alexa Smart Home skills that help customers find important things they have misplaced such as keys, wallets, headphones, remotes, and even pets. Customers can simply say ‘Alexa, Find my’ or ‘Alexa, Ring my’ to locate tracked items. We are now opening up Find My to support additional device makers with this launch. Samsung and Remote+ will be adding Find My capabilities in 2021.
EXPANDING DEVICE DISCOVERY
Customers use Alexa to control smart home devices hundreds of millions of times each week. These include cameras, garage doors, lights, locks, and more. And now we’re expanding Device Discovery to help customers discover additional Alexa compatible devices, like a printer or a Smart TV that are connected to the same wireless network. This enables more device makers to integrate Device Discovery into their products, and more customers to engage with devices through Alexa and leverage your device’s smart capabilities.

EXPANDING ALEXA’S REPLENISHMENT CAPABIILITY
Alexa can already reorder items like batteries, printer ink, detergent and dryer sheets. To further simplify customer lives, we are extending Alexa’s replenishment capability to replacement parts. And you can also earn recurring revenue every time these replacement parts are ordered through Alexa. Many brands like Carrier and Resideo are enabling their thermostats to replenish Air Filters, while Bissell is doing the same for robot vacuum cleaners.

ALEXA GUARD UPDATES
Soon we will help customers make their homes even more secure. Customers in the U.S. will be able to connect to smart safety devices such as smoke, carbon-monoxide and water leak detectors with Alexa to better protect their homes. When these smart safety devices detect an incident, Alexa Guard can send customers a Smart Alert mobile notification. Kidde, Moen, First Alert, and YoSmart are already integrating their smart detectors with Alexa.
ALEXA CONVERSATIONS

At Alexa Live last year, we announced Alexa Conversations, a deep learning-based approach to dialog management to enable more conversational interactions. Since we made Alexa Conversations generally available, thousands of skill builders have used the tools to power experiences that serve millions of customer interactions. Engagement for these skills have more than doubled in the same period. The team behind “Art Museum” found it faster and simpler to build a contest-winning experience using Alexa Conversations. Their skill helps customers explore the Art Institute of Chicago’s digital collection from home.
We are also expanding availability of Alexa Conversations in beta in German, in all English locales, and in a developer preview in Japan. Learn more about Alexa Conversations.

ALEXA SKILL COMPONENTS
We want to make skill coding easier. Today, we’re announcing Alexa Skill Components. These components let you build skills faster by simply plugging them into your existing voice models and code libraries. Spend less time writing foundational code and more time on the unique aspects of your skill using Skill Components. Skill Components are “ready to use” experiences that you can easily add to your skills. Each component follows best practices and uses the latest conversational AI and multimodal capabilities. Alexa Skill Components are now available in Developer Preview and you can apply here.

VOICE-FORWARD ACCOUNT LINKING + VOICE FORWARD CONSENT
Today, customers can set up voice profiles to enable Alexa to recognize their voice and personalize their experience. You can already leverage this feature within your skill experience to differentiate between speakers, or remember user preferences and settings. Now, Voice Forward Account Linking and Voice Forward Consent make it easier for customers to connect their account on your system, or create a new one within your skill experience. With these features, customers can consent through voice to share information from their Alexa voice profile, such as name and phone number. This reduces the need for customers to remember account credentials and gets them into your skill experience, faster.

ALEXA SKILL DESIGN GUIDE
We continue to invest in ways to lower the complexity and investment in building and maintaining skills. We’re announcing a new version of the Alexa Skill Design Guide. The guide codifies lessons learned from Amazon’s developers and broader skill builder community. Rooted in a voice-first design methodology, this guide covers the full development lifecycle. We think you’ll find this guide useful regardless of whether you’re new to designing skills or need guidance on more advanced use cases.

ALEXA ENTITIES
Alexa Entities is now generally available. This feature lets your skill retrieve information from Alexa’s knowledge graph. For example, you might want to know about the population and capital of Belgium, or the average weight of a hippo. With the Alexa Entities feature, you no longer have to source, acquire or manage your own catalogue of general knowledge. You can find out more about Alexa Entities here.

CUSTOMIZED PRONUNCIATIONS
We’re launching Customized Pronunciations, a self-service tool that allows you to add custom pronunciation for rare words to your skill models – think of character names, game titles, and medicine names. Apply today for the limited developer preview.  

SAMPLE UTTERANCE RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
A new AI-based Sample Utterance Recommendation Engine is now available in public beta. This feature uses grammar induction, sequence-to-sequence transformers, and data filtering to recommend utterances for your skills, to save you time.

SKILL A/B TESTING SERVICE + TEST-GENERATION TOOL
We’re launching two new tools for skill testing. Our Skill A/B Testing Service lets you perform A/B tests, make data-driven launch decisions and then control the dial-up of new feature releases.  Our Test-Generation Tool helps you build testing capabilities for consolidated batch testing. We hope both of these features will help you iterate and publish skill updates more frequently.

AVS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT EXPANSION
We’re making it easier to sell Alexa-integrated devices all around the world, starting with increased international support for the Alexa Voice Service, or AVS. This popular service for integrating Alexa directly into devices will soon be available in over 25 countries – and we’re adding support for multiple new languages including Spanish, French, Italian, and Japanese.

ALEXA CONNECT KIT INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Similarly, it will soon be possible to prototype and sell Alexa Connect Kit, or ACK, devices outside of the US.  With this service, you purchase the Amazon-managed ACK hardware module and pay one, low upfront fee that covers use of the ACK cloud service for your product’s lifetime. Many device makers including Sharp, Globe Electric, and Vornado have leveraged the Alexa Connect Kit to delight customers and improve time to market in devices ranging from microwaves to fans to lamps. Our ACK roadmap for this year includes Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, India, and Australia.
MATTER
We have always believed in creating an open smart home environment. By supporting multiple smart home protocols, we make it easier for device makers and developers to collaborate with Alexa and create innovative solutions for our mutual customers. For the past year and a half, we and other leading smart home manufacturers have been developing a new interoperability protocol called Matter. The primary goal of this new standard is to make it easy for customers to know that their smart home devices will work with all major voice services. For device makers, Matter will significantly cut down the effort required to build a new smart home device.
Today, we are announcing that we will be upgrading our Echo Family devices to work with Matter. This includes most Echo and Echo Dot devices and all Echo Studio, Echo Flex, Echo Plus, and Echo Show devices. These changes will help millions of Echo customers set up and control Matter products easily with their Echo devices. We will soon be rolling out tools that make it easy for you to build Matter certified devices, and are ready to start testing your Matter devices now.

VOICE INTEROPERABILITY INITIATIVE
We launched the Voice Interoperability Initiative (or VII) in late 2019. There are multiple voice agents available today, each with its own set of skills and capabilities, and customers should have the freedom to easily access their preferred voice agent for any given task. VII was created to support this vision. The program now has nearly90 members working towards this vision, including Facebook, Intel, Qualcomm, Sonos, Garmin, and other global brands.

MULTI-AGENT TOOLS
We will soon release the Multi-agent Experience (MAX) Toolkit. The MAX Toolkit provides middleware components for multi-agent integrations and presents a solution that will make it easier and faster to develop multi-agent products. Partners building multi-agent devices include SmartTVs featuring ThinQ’s ‘Hi LG’ service and Alexa. Also, Samsung’s next generation of Family Hub Refrigerators offer even more convenience and control at home, now with Alexa Built-in.
 
ALEXA CUSTOM ASSISTANT
The Alexa Custom Assistant, or ACA, is a comprehensive solution that makes easy for any brand to create their own custom voice assistant, with a unique wake word, voice, personality, and capabilities built on Alexa technology. In January we announced global automaker Stellantis as the launch customer for ACA. We’ve continued momentum since then with Qualcomm, Garmin and most recently, Elektrobit and Continental, announcing the first integration of ACA in a production vehicle. Today we’re also announcing that Verizon will soon launch a smart display that leverages the ACA technology. Verizon Customers will use Verizon Smart Display to set up their new service and manage their account, including any troubleshooting, giving them more flexibility to oversee their broadband options.
We continue to relentlessly innovate so you can build world-class voice technology and ambient computing experiences for our shared customers. Whether you’re a developer, brand, or device maker, we’re building the tools and removing barriers for you to do what you do best. There’s never been a better time to develop for Alexa.

Our Vision: Building a World of Ambient Computing Together;Mon Jul 12 12:36:00 UTC 2021;Amazon Developer Team;"Better sensors, AI, connectivity, and edge computing are starting to come together to give us homes and neighborhoods that are smarter in ways that matter: our latest devices and services are already able to understand the context of your home, predict your needs, and act on your behalf. We call this ambient computing: technology that is proactive, personal but also communal, and based on an interface you don’t have to learn. We believe voice is an incredibly natural way to interact with your home and technology in general – and it will continue to be integral to our vision—but a truly ambient experience means you’ll talk to Alexa less, or in some cases not at all.
People are embracing ambient computing like never before. Already, 1 in 4 Alexa smart home interactions are initiated by Alexa—without customers saying anything— thanks to predictive and proactive features like Alexa Guard, Routines, and Hunches. Partners ranging from LEGOLAND and Aiva Health to Lamborghini have rolled out new Alexa-enabled products in recent months.
Early on, we recognized that the home represented a vast but untapped opportunity for invention – and that AI, voice, and other emerging technologies could be woven together to make a real difference for customers. The progress we’ve made towards realizing the promise of ambient computing is one of the most exciting evolutions we’ve witnessed. It’s fundamentally reinventing the way people engage with technology, making our customers’ lives easier and better without getting in the way. And we’re not stopping at your front door; we’re investing in inventions like Sidewalk and auto products – as well as services like Amazon Halo – that enable you to access ambient technology throughout your day.
We believe you shouldn’t have to choose between innovation and privacy. That’s why privacy is foundational to all of our devices and services, and core to how we think about building ambient computing. We prioritize customer privacy and security in lots of ways: customers have transparency and control, including the ability to turn off certain features and settings – as well as certain signals and sensors – on or off. We minimize data collection to what is needed to power and improve customer experiences. 

 Amazon has always been focused on removing friction for customers – whether that’s buying a book or accessing on-demand computing power. That’s why today we’re focused on inventing for a world where technology is always available to make life easier and better without getting in your way. We believe ambient is the future, and we’re excited about the progress we’re making on behalf of our customers.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/07/building-a-world-of-ambient-computing-together;
5 Alexa Innovations You Should Know Before Alexa Live;Tue Jul 06 11:24:00 UTC 2021;Jeff Blankenburg;"Are you ready for Alexa Live 2021? This year’s virtual event is coming up on July 21, and we can’t wait to share the latest Alexa innovations helping our vision for the future of ambient computing come to life. Before we get started, though, let’s take a look at five of the top Alexa developer innovations introduced over the past year. These tools and features are available right now to help make your life as a developer simpler—and to keep your customers more engaged and satisfied.
We know developers are always looking for ways to improve discoverability of their skills. Quick Links for Alexa (beta) allows developers to add links to launch their Alexa skills directly from mobile apps, websites, online ads, social media, emails, and other marketing channels. Quick Links can make it easier for customers to find and gain direct access to your skill, while making it easier for you to track conversion from the use of online ads.
Simply put, Quick Links can make it easier for customers to discover your skill and its most engaging features—without having to remember a specific invocation phrase to say to Alexa. Quick Links can take a user directly to the experience you want with a simple click or tap, without the need to navigate menus. With Quick Links, developers can also generate QR codes that can be shared via smartphones, computer screens, or other types of signage. Displaying QR codes boosts awareness, encourages engagement, and supports your other skill or device marketing initiatives.
For more information about Quick Links for Alexa, go here.
More and more, customers are seeking immersive experiences, rich in motion, audio, and visual content to teach, inform, and entertain. The latest version of Alexa Presentation Language, APL 1.6, enables you to build richer experiences that incorporate motion and adapt to a wider range of devices. APL 1.6 also enables specific choreographed motions—also known as choreos—for Echo Show 10. Using the new APL authoring tool, you can now easily convert Lottie files into Alexa Vector Graphics, and use them in your visual responses. Other features include custom Pager transitions, viewport profiles for tablets, and resizing and rescaling for layouts, enabling you to tailor the visuals when switching between portrait and landscape orientations. APL 1.6 simplifies incorporating advanced audio, visual, and motion effects into your Alexa skills, raising the bar for customer engagement for Alexa-enabled devices with screens.
For more information on APL 1.6, go here.
Another new, exciting feature available to Alexa skill developers is Multi-Value Slots. It’s a significant step toward building Alexa skills that understand more complex commands and utterances.
Skill developers spend many hours developing interactions that are natural and conversational, and offer customers a more engaging, memorable experience. One thing that makes interaction with a skill feel natural is the skill’s ability to understand when users provide multiple values of the same type in a single sentence. While this occurs naturally in everyday conversations between people, this could be a challenge for skill developers.
Here’s an example of how using Multi-Value Slots can make a skill feel more natural. Let’s say you are making dinner at home for the family, and turn to Alexa for suggestions. Without Multi-Value Slots, you’d have to ask Alexa for meal suggestions using one ingredient at a time. With Multi-Value Slots, you could instead ask, “Alexa, what can I cook for dinner with roasted cauliflower, carrots, and sweet potatoes?” Allowing multiple values at once not only reduces the time it takes the user to request the desired information, but it’s also how we would ask the question in everyday conversation.
For more information on Multi-Value Slots, go here.
Simply put, Alexa Skills Toolkit for Visual Studio Code is an open-source software extension that makes it easier for developers to create, test, and deploy Alexa skills. It features a dedicated workspace and provides many features for managing and previewing your skill projects, including the simulator interface you’ve become familiar with in the Developer Console, and an APL document previewer. Developers can also opt to test and debug their skills in VS Code with local debugging, which dramatically reduces development time. The ASK Toolkit extension can turn VS Code into a fully functioning Alexa skill development environment.
For more information on ASK Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, go here.
The Alexa Conversations dialog manager for Alexa Skills Kit uses an AI-driven approach to dialog management to help developers create skills that provide customers with more natural Alexa interactions. The dialog manager enables developers to build skills that allow customers to use the phrases they prefer, in the order they prefer to use them, rather than constrain them to a rigid, predefined speech pattern. Thousands of developers worldwide are already building more natural voice experiences with Alexa Conversations, giving them the freedom to focus on the most valuable parts of the experience, rather than focusing on how a customer interaction will flow. Alexa skill builders—including well-known brands like iRobot—agree that Alexa Conversations makes it faster and easier to build and enhance natural language processing, including tasks like catalog selection, guided inquiry, and scheduling.
For more information on Alexa Conversations, go here.
We’ll feature these Alexa innovations and much more at Alexa Live on July 21, so make sure to get registered today.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2021/07/alexa-innovations-you-should-know-before-alexa-live;
Why Amazon Believes There Can Be Many Winners in Voice Technology;Thu Jun 24 14:48:00 UTC 2021;Kellie Garnett;"Voice technology is poised to deliver truly ambient experiences—that is, experiences where a customer isn’t tethered to a single device or even a single voice service. As passionate as we are about Amazon’s Alexa voice technology, we see a world with plenty of room for other voice services to succeed. That means customers will have the freedom to choose the voice service or services that provide the capabilities they want in ways best suited to their individual needs. We think that’s a win for everyone.
For everyone to win, makers of voice-enabled devices—from smart speakers to smart home appliances to car infotainment systems and beyond—can create multi-agent experiences that allow customers to have a choice and flexibility to use their preferred voice assistant in a given device to make those choices easily and seamlessly. Let’s explore a few of the reasons and design considerations for creating multi-agent experiences for our customers.
Ambient computing experiences shine in environments where you’re occupied with multiple tasks. Using voice technology, ambient computing can strip away complexity and minimize distractions to make those other tasks more productive and entertaining—whether you are working, cooking, or even navigating traffic in your car.
We’re committed to allowing customers to be able to use available voice agents simultaneously via dedicated wake words. In addition, these agents should cooperate to provide a delightful experience for customers. The fundamental principle of Amazon’s Voice Interoperability Initiative (VII) is that a customer using voice-enabled devices like smart speakers, screens, and even automobiles should be able to choose which voice services to use. Further, customers should have the freedom to use multiple voice agents simultaneously, selecting their preferred voice service for each interaction. Already, customers can experience devices that support multiple voice agents via Facebook Portal, Garmin DriveSmart 65, DT Magenta speaker, LG 2020 and 2021 TVs, and the Vodafone ES smart speaker.
Also, don’t forget to enable universal device commands (UDCs). UDCs are commands a customer can use with a compatible agent to control available device functions, regardless of whether the agent was used to initiate the action. Device global commands can be initiated by each agent on its own, such as increasing or decreasing the device’s audio volume. Cross-agent commands often require state information to be shared from the device to enable agents to interpret the request correctly. An example of this might be for one agent to stop the alarm on a timer initiated by another agent. UDCs enable customers to interact naturally and instinctively with multi-agent devices.
As we move closer to an ambient future, supporting simultaneous agents on voice-enabled products is just one way device makers can build a more satisfying experience for customers. Amazon also offers the Alexa Custom Assistant (ACA), a solution that lets companies create intelligent assistants that are built on Alexa technology and work in cooperation with Alexa.
Device makers and service providers can use ACA to build intelligent assistants into any capable device, including automobiles and consumer electronics like smart displays, speakers, set top boxes, home appliances, fitness devices, and more. ACA provides these companies a comprehensive, managed voice solution that reduces the cost and complexity of building it from the ground up. And for their customers, ACA can provide a familiar yet unique experience for setup and operation of the device. Custom skills could be used to control a device like increasing the incline on a treadmill, changing the channel on a set top box, or starting a robot vacuum. They can also automate and scale customer interactions, such as providing troubleshooting guidance and helping customers learn more about device capabilities. In fact, thus far, a number of big-brand companies have partnered with us to integrate ACA into their products, including FCA/Stellantis (Amazon’s first ACA integration partner), Qualcomm (with its Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit Platform), and Garmin (a Tier 1 supplier of vehicle infotainment systems).
Device makers and service providers can even customize their brand’s assistant with a unique wake word, voice, and capabilities – providing customers the benefits of an intelligent assistant that is their product and services expert, while seamlessly coexisting and cooperating with Alexa. In short, ACA makes it even easier to support seamless multi-agent experiences.
Need another example of a device maker using tools like these to provide a seamless experience between the user and their devices?
With Alexa Custom Assistant, all sorts of custom experiences can be programmed into devices, enabling a natural dialog between the driver, the custom assistant, and Alexa to fulfill the driver’s request. Alexa’s advanced AI ensures each request is routed to the assistant that can provide the most relevant and delightful experience. For example, if a customer asks Alexa to roll down a car window, or why their check engine light is on, the request will be seamlessly routed to the brand’s assistant. Check out this deep dive with an Amazonian who works on creating great experiences for customers specifically in vehicles. If a customer asks the brand’s assistant to play an audio book, the request will be routed to Alexa.
In June, automotive software and hardware supplier Elektrobit and Continental announced a major milestone in automotive embedded voice experiences: the first in-vehicle integration of Alexa Custom Assistant, a comprehensive solution that lets automakers access Alexa’s advanced AI to create their own branded, intelligent assistants. The collaboration brings together Continental’s automotive electronics and Elektrobit’s software expertise, integrating Alexa Custom Assistant into Continental’s Cockpit High Performance Computer with software and integration services provided by Elektrobit.
By integrating Alexa Custom Assistant into an actual production vehicle, automakers can now truly experience the solution as part of a fully integrated digital cockpit. It gives them insights into the solution’s true value proposition and encourages the imagination of new, differentiating use cases. By tightly integrating Elektrobit and Continental's hardware and software with Alexa’s AI and intelligent assistants, automakers can now fast track the addition of industry-leading, customized, and highly differentiating voice experiences to their vehicles.

From the Workplace to Communities to Hospitality, Alexa Helps Businesses Everywhere Become More Successful;Wed Jun 23 17:11:00 UTC 2021;Kellie Garnett;"With hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices sold, there’s no doubt—consumers love Alexa in their homes, in their cars, and on their mobile devices. However, delivering engaging, voice-first experiences to customers at any time and place throughout their day means extending outside a consumer’s personal devices. That’s why we see growing momentum in new and exciting areas, too, including Alexa solutions for various industries.
Let’s explore some of the opportunities for leveraging Alexa in businesses, then see how one prominent Las Vegas resort scored big by delivering customized, contact-less voice experiences to its guests.
Who would have imagined, after more than a year of pandemic-induced working from home, we might be ready to head back into the office? As we move closer to that point (and each other), the lessons of 2020 emphasize the need for infrastructure that allows us to interact with each other via hands-free conferencing and meeting rooms. COVID-19 aside, Gartner had already predicted 40% of formal meetings would be facilitated by virtual AI and advanced analytics by 2020.
With Alexa for Business integrated into Zoom Rooms Appliances, companies of any size can leverage Alexa’s workplace and home office capabilities to increase productivity and improve the meeting room and video call experience—all while creating a touch-free office environment. Setting up Alexa for Business and administering the devices is quick and straightforward via the Zoom Room portal, whether for a single room, a floor, a whole building, or an entire corporate campus.
By linking Alexa for Business to the organization’s calendaring system, Alexa can find available meeting rooms, create, send and modify calendar events, and remind attendees of upcoming meetings. Meeting organizers and attendees need only to use their voices to book an available room, start their meeting, or join a scheduled meeting. Meetings are instantly more productive and engaging experiences without touching (and sanitizing) screens or fighting to get various technologies to work together correctly.
People in the office aren’t the only ones who can benefit from Alexa for Business. Some companies seek to provide residential services throughout entire communities or buildings, such as apartment complexes. Enter Alexa for Residential. Alexa for Residential enables these companies to deploy and manage Alexa-enabled devices and experiences across residential buildings with the help of solution providers. Through Alexa for Residential, you can provide voice-enabled smart home experiences to your residents from the moment they move in. Residential property owners and property management companies can make their properties more attractive to residents with just a one-time investment and setup.

Alexa-enabled devices can be standard fixtures provided as part of each unit, just like other home appliances. With these devices, residents can instantly control the lights, thermostats, smoke detectors, locks, blinds, and more, with no setup required on their part. Further, Alexa and Echo devices are designed with multiple layers of privacy protection, from microphone and camera controls to the ability to view and delete your voice recordings. Property staff, management, and smart home providers do not have access to Alexa voice recordings.
If home users, business users, and community residents love Alexa experiences, why not make them part of the business trip or vacation experience, too? Alexa for Hospitality provides device fleet management so you can build immersive voice-first experiences that delight your hotel guests—customized Alexa capabilities that scale to hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds-of-thousands of devices.
Alexa for Hospitality simplifies tasks like playing music, checking the weather, calling the front desk, ordering room service, controlling in-room temperature or lighting—even checking out with just a few words. Providing such intuitive experiences can be a crucial differentiator that draws more guests, increases revenues, reduces costs, and improves guest satisfaction.

Now Available: Set Up Alexa Voice Service Devices Through the Alexa App;Tue Jun 15 00:00:00 UTC 2021;Sanjay Ramaswamy;"With connected devices becoming increasingly ubiquitous around the world, customers have come to expect a struggle-free, tinker-free, and stress-free experience when setting up their devices. The complexity of setting up devices is often cited as one of the top issues in customer reviews, leading to poor product engagement and satisfaction. Amazon’s Echo Family of devices addressed this by using Frustration-Free Setup (FFS) technology to provide simple and delightful setup experiences.
 
We are excited to announce that we are bringing FFS to devices powered by Alexa Voice Service (AVS) using Amazon Common Software (ACS) for Devices.  Devices that integrate this technology will be able to provide customers with multiple user-friendly WiFi setup paths in the Alexa app. Eligible customers that purchase these devices on Amazon.com can enjoy a delightful simplified setup experience when they power on their device. Customers that purchase elsewhere or receive the device as a gift will receive an auto-discovery notification in their Alexa app and can complete setup with just a few clicks. Customers can also perform a manual setup of the device in the Alexa app by choosing the brand and model. The setup will retrieve the customer’s credentials from their Amazon WiFi Locker if saved as part of a previous Amazon device setup, so they don’t have to re-enter them.
 
This lets customers set up devices with just one app. Device makers no longer need to create and maintain their own app for device setup, and can instead focus their resources on core device features. With a few additional requirements, devices may become eligible for the Certified for Humans (CFH) program. CFH is an Amazon certification program for Alexa-compatible devices that identifies high-quality smart home experiences across setup, usability, and performance. Certified for Humans devices are struggle-free, tinker-free, stress-free.
 
Device Makers are adopting FFS
Hear from two device makers that have adopted Amazon’s Frustration-Free Setup.
 
“Amazon’s Frustration-Free Setup (FFS) allowed our design team to integrate the new Polk React soundbar with the same out-of-box experience that millions of Amazon customers are already familiar with. We were able to integrate network setup and configuration of the Polk React soundbar directly into the Alexa app, which saved us significant development time as we were not required to design, develop, test, launch and update our own companion app. The outcome is that our customers can have the easiest possible setup experience by simply connecting a power cord - and like magic, Alexa is ready to play music!” says Marty Wachter, Director of UX & Technology for Sound United
 
“HARMAN is excited to be part of Amazon’s Frustration-Free Setup initiative for Alexa devices, offering our customers an easier, simpler set-up process in some of our home audio devices.  This technology is incorporated in the JBL Bar 5.0 MultiBeam soundbar, allowing customers to experience the WiFi Simple Setup feature when connecting to their home entertainment system, and we look forward to expanding the offering to other smart products moving forward.” says Rodney Chan, Vice President and General Manager for HARMAN Home Audio
When an AVS device (a provisionee seeking to be registered) powers up, it establishes a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection with a nearby Echo device or the Alexa app (a provisioner registered on the user’s account). The provisioner authenticates the device, and provides it with WiFi credentials, if available. Once WiFi setup is complete, the device is authorized for registration and Alexa is enabled on the device
You can start building with chipsets that work with ACS and FFS from Solution Providers Mediatek, NXP, Amlogic, Espressif, and Qorvo. You can also engage Solution Providers Tonly, Innotech, Linkplay, and Stream Unlimited for help with the FFS integration on your AVS device.
Visit this page to learn more about this technology for AVS devices and documentation on how to get started, which includes a simplified onboarding process for AVS devices to FFS using the AVS developer portal.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2021/06/now-available-set-up-alexa-voice-service-devices-through-the-alexa-app;

Show Mode automatically turns your Lenovo PC into a smart display at no additional cost, so you can ask Alexa to show you trending news stories, listen to music or set a timer from across the room. From convertible laptops to notebooks, the rich, responsive visuals adapt seamlessly to different Lenovo PC form factors. Show Mode brings new life to PCs by allowing users to do more with their PC, even when they step away from it. Just say, “Alexa, open Show Mode,” or click on the ‘Show Mode’ button in the Alexa app on your PC to get started.
Show Mode supports many of your favorite Alexa features so you can ask for information on a wide range of topics, try popular recipes, play games, set reminders, create to-do lists, ask Alexa to read your favorite audiobook from Audible, and more.  Plus, customers can easily control compatible smart home devices, or use Drop In to instantly check-in with approved contacts with just their voice. Alexa for PC utilizes the PC’s stunning graphics, large displays, high quality microphones, and processing power to deliver a rich, immersive customer experience. Alexa for PC in Show Mode allows users to get more utility out of their PC even when the PC is inactive. With the ‘set it and forget it’ Alexa experience in Show Mode, users can talk to Alexa on a large screen display without having to either be in front of their PC at all times or reach for their phone to get things done. With more than 100,000 skills, Alexa can help you get more out of the things you already love and discover new possibilities you've never imagined.
 
“We are excited to bring Alexa’s rich, visual ambient experience to PCs.” said Aaron Rubenson, Vice President Alexa Voice Service and Alexa Skills.  “Customers love the fact that Alexa is always accessible.  With Show Mode, Alexa is helping make PCs more versatile and adaptive, enabling richer experiences throughout the home or wherever customers may take their PC.”
 
In collaboration with Amazon, Lenovo first announced Alexa Show Mode on PCs at CES 2021 on the flagship Lenovo Yoga Slim 9i laptop. By teaming with Amazon, Lenovo optimized the Show Mode experience with automatic enablement when the device is idle and improved acoustic quality and battery performance, taking advantage of the best-in-class hardware on Lenovo PCs. “Improving device simplicity and the user experience is at the heart of Lenovo’s customer-centric innovation culture. A voice-enabled interface will be a big part of that endeavor,” said Igor Bergman, Vice President of Cloud and Software, Intelligent Devices Group at Lenovo. “That’s why Lenovo is the first to bring to market Alexa Show Mode on PCs. By enabling Show Mode on Lenovo PCs, we are providing customers with a highly versatile user experience on a natural and convenient interface.”

 How Toshiba Created a New, Voice-enabled TV Experience;Thu Mar 18 13:40:00 UTC 2021;Kristin Fritsche;"""We believe that Voice Control for TV can become in the long run what touch screen was for the mobile phone industry. It will completely transform the way we interact with our TVs – and Toshiba TV is already well on the way to achieving this.”
- Bart Kuijten, commercial director, Toshiba TVs in Europe
The smart TV as home entertainment – that is Toshiba TV’s vision for the future of television. The brand, which is part of the Japanese IT and electronics giant Toshiba Corporation, is focused on integrating new smart functions and interaction concepts into television sets around the world. Recent innovations include the TRU Picture Engine, a tool that upscales lower-resolution picture content for 4K TVs and optimises it for a smooth and detailed display.
Toshiba TV is motivated by the desire to reinforce televisions as an attractive and sustainable option within the ecosystem of digital connectivity – while offering this premium technology at a retail price affordable for as many people as possible.
Viewing habits are changing, especially among younger generations. At a time when TV and video content is increasingly viewed on smart mobile devices, a top priority is continuously improving and enhancing the user experience of stationary Toshiba TV devices. The answer: a technology that is exciting, networkable, and fun and will appeal to users of all generations.
Voice technology is singularly suited to achieving this goal. Because communicating through voice is both convenient and intuitive, the technology is accessible to everyone, from children to the tech-savvy or older generations. Voice control has become an increasingly essential factor for developers and manufacturers of smart devices – including smart TVs.
Integrating gesture control technology into Toshiba TVs did not yield satisfactory results. The development of a voice-enabled TV, which can be operated completely hands-free and serves as an integrative part of the smart home architecture, is strengthening the positioning of Toshiba TV as an innovative brand, giving it an edge over competitors' products.
Toshiba TV had previously launched joint development projects with Amazon, including the integration of Prime Video. The synergy between technological expertise, comprehensive service offerings for developers and a directly connected retail platform were further incentives for choosing Alexa as the basis for Toshiba’s voice control technology.
""The Alexa brand is now firmly established as a leading player in the voice market,"" says Kuijten. ""In addition to the outstanding technological possibilities Alexa Voice Service offers us, it is a great advantage that end customers, dealers and developers know and understand the brand.”
In 2018, Toshiba TV first launched selected devices that made it possible to control UHD and Full HD smart TVs via Amazon Echo or Echo Dot (Works with Alexa). In 2019 Toshiba launched the first Alexa Built-in integration within their UL5A series (4K) and one year later in 2020, the UK4B (4K HDR) and WK3 (HD) series. “Moving to Alexa Built-In was a natural progression”, says Kuijten, “we have released several models to market that Work With Alexa last year. Customers told us they loved the flexibility and ease this afforded them. The TV experience provided by Alexa Built-in is perfect for customers who want to talk directly to the TV to access content, services, and more, whether on the main screen in the living room or a second TV in the kitchen or bedroom.” Today, most 4K HDR and Full HD smart TVs from Toshiba TV in this series come with Alexa features and all smart TV functions can be operated via voice control. Additional central Alexa functions such as smart home applications, calendar management, Amazon Music, weather reports, and other information services are also available via the smart TV.
Brands can take advantage of the well-known Amazon Alexa brand messaging for their PR and marketing activities: “The Alexa Built-in proposition provided us with some fantastic marketing opportunities. From a PR perspective, media loved that the WK3 model was a UK first and having the capabilities of an Alexa product within a TV means you could build a smart home ecosystem around the screen. The UK4B model introduced a premium cinematic experience to this new dynamic, meaning the main screen in the living room could become the hub of a smart home – this was a really interesting story from a PR perspective.”
“We knew this story would also resonate with our wider audience on social media. For both social media and digital advertising, we had to think video-first to ensure our audience saw the maximum impact of having Alexa Built-In. We produced Alexa-focused product videos, and also partnered with social influencers to demonstrate how the UK4B’s voice control not only improved their TV viewing, but also a range of activities they could now do using the TV, such as exercising and baking.”
Customer Convenience
Voice control based on Alexa built-in removes the need for a remote control, thereby significantly increasing customer convenience in a range of everyday situations. Be it in the kitchen, bedroom, or living room, users can control stationary TV sets with their voices alone. The result is a more natural, easy way of interaction that is both technologically advanced and highly accessible.


Future-proof Concept
The new generation of Toshiba TVs benefits from the growing range of compatible smart home devices. Also Alexa skills, both existing and future ones, will automatically be available to the end customer, making sure that the user experience remains enjoyable and convenient even as the technology progresses.

Works With Alexa (WWA) Brings Peace of Mind for Customers of Schlage’s Encode Smart Locks;Mon Feb 01 15:02:00 UTC 2021;Ben Grossman;"We strive to make it easier for customers to discover, learn about, and buy the great products you build. Amazon offers numerous ways to increase exposure of your Alexa-connected products to the millions of customers who shop on Amazon.com every day. Programs like Works with Alexa (WWA) not only ensure you provide a great customer experience, but also raise the visibility of your Alexa-connected products on Amazon.com and other channels. To date, WWA program has helped generate billions of dollars for device makers. When your products are certified, they can carry the Works with Alexa badge on your product packaging, on your Amazon detail page, notation in Amazon search, and become eligible for additional placements within the Amazon Smart Home Store and dedicated Amazon Works with Alexa Store. Brands like Schlage® use WWA to build confidence in their Alexa-connected products, increase their visibility, and boost their business.

With a nearly 100 year track record, Schlage has always been proud to offer the strongest and most durable security products for homes, multi-family, commercial, and institutional buildings. Today, with its Schlage Encode™ series of WiFi- and voice-enabled smart locks and an Alexa Smart Home Skill, Schlage is leading the way with one of the most technologically advanced security products. Not bad for a company that made its name in 1920 with the original push button lock. Today, Alexa's voice and automation capabilities are a cornerstone for Schlage's innovation strategy.

“By 2018, users expected voice control of their locks,” said Mark Jenner, director of technology alliances for Allegion, maker of Schlage locks. “For Schlage, that meant Alexa integration was a must-have for our revolutionary Schlage Encode smart Wifi deadbolt, from day one.”
Does it surprise you that a century-old lock maker would today be on the leading edge of voice-enabled access control technology? It won’t once you learn that innovation and home automation have always been the name of the game at Schlage.

“Believe it or not, founder Walter Schlage patented an automated door lock in 1915,” said Jenner. “The idea was that when you turned the door handle, it turned on the lights. Though the device was never developed and sold, it shows that Schlage has always looked for innovative ways to meet and exceed customer desires.”

Some 90 years later, the company continued its tradition of innovation by launching its first smart lock. These devices allowed home and business owners to check the status of the lock remotely—meaning they never had to worry about having forgotten to lock the door. Remote locking capabilities arrived in 2013, using the Z-Wave wireless communication protocol and a third-party app.

But it was adding voice control that took Schlage locks to the next level, first with a custom Alexa skill then an Alexa Smart Home Skill. In 2018 the Schlage Encode debuted, an advanced WiFi- and voice-enabled smart lock that worked seamlessly with Alexa, Amazon Key and the Schlage home app.

“The latest Smart Home Skill API allows us to offer added security, like two-factor authentication, when using Alexa to unlock the door,” said Jenner. “Our customers get the convenience of unlocking their doors by voice and the peace of mind that a stranger can’t do it from outside.”
Many customers now see Alexa integration as a “minimum requirement” for smart home products. Schlage customers also demand quality in every aspect of its smart access control products, including how they function in today’s voice-enabled smart homes. That’s why the company obtained Amazon’s Works With Alexa (WWA) certification to build customer confidence that its smart locks will work seamlessly and reliably with Alexa. The Works With Alexa (WWA) program ensures quality, reliability, and responsiveness of devices that connect to Alexa.

“WWA certification means something to the customer,” said Jenner. “They see the badge and say, ‘I know this product will work.’ Certification tells them the product was tested at an independent lab and met demanding standards.”

Works With Alexa certification adds even more customer confidence. That’s because WWA certification requires products to meet WWA program guidelines, undergo third-party lab testing, and validate the product integrates with Alexa. Once certified, companies must maintain a consistently good customer experience. Amazon ensures this by continually reviewing customer feedback, product star ratings, service latency, and device cloud up-time.
“The process took just a few weeks to complete, after which Schlage could display the WWA badge on product listings on the website,” said Jenner. “The WWA badge bolsters our company’s reputation for innovation and quality.
Customers aren’t the only ones who benefit from WWA certification. Third-party testing assures manufacturers like Schlage that their products meet a rigorous standard while boosting their products' exposure and sales on Amazon.com. The WWA badge on product listings gives them an advantage when customers search Amazon's website for smart home or other certified Works With Alexa products. As an added bonus, WWA certification creates an additional marketing opportunity, such as creating and selling product promotion bundles.

“The WWA badge further bolsters customer perception and brand trust and sends an explicit message that we stand behind our product in every way,” said Jenner. “Our company’s innovation has evolved from the pure mechanical world to the digital world, and WWA certification assures customers that our smart home products will continue to meet and exceed the high standards they’ve come to expect from Schlage.”

"For the first time, Amazon enables companies to access Alexa’s advanced AI to build their own intelligent assistants with Alexa Custom Assistant; Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is the first Automotive OEM to implement in vehicles";Fri Jan 15 11:34:00 UTC 2021;Ned Curic;"Today, Amazon announced Alexa Custom Assistant, a comprehensive new solution that lets device makers and service providers create intelligent assistants tailored to their brand personality and customer needs. The Alexa Custom Assistant is built directly on Alexa technology, providing companies access to world class, always-improving voice AI technology, customized with unique wake word, voice, skills, and capabilities. The brand’s assistant also seamlessly coexists and cooperates with Alexa, providing customers the benefits of an intelligent assistant that is their product and services expert, while Alexa provides the familiar experiences they already know and love. The Alexa Custom Assistant reduces the cost and complexity of building intelligent assistants into automobiles, consumer electronics, mobile applications, smart properties, video games, and a variety of other digital experiences.   
Global automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) is the first Alexa Custom Assistant customer, and has already begun the planning process for the development of an FCA-branded intelligent assistant for integration in select vehicle models. The company’s work builds on existing Alexa integrations in its vehicles around the world.

""Our customers expect to easily connect with their digital lifestyles wherever they go and today we responded with plans to offer new intelligent experiences built on Alexa’s world-class voice AI technology,” said Mark Stewart, Chief Operating Officer, FCA - North America. “We look forward to the expanding partnership with Amazon and the integration of Alexa Custom Assistant within our powerful Uconnect system as we continue on our path to put customer needs and expectations at the center of everything we do.""
Innovation, without the hefty investment
Building an intelligent assistant is complex, time-consuming, and costly. Further, the rate of innovation and change is accelerating and assistants are always improving and getting smarter, requiring substantial ongoing investments. The Alexa Custom Assistant addresses this challenge by allowing companies to leverage Alexa’s world-class technology stack to create their own intelligent assistant without the investment, long development cycles, and resources to build it from scratch and maintain over time.
The Alexa Custom Assistant is based on constantly-improving spoken language understanding, intent routing, and response orchestration to provide a natural, intelligent, and conversational interface. Custom wake words are created using the same state-of-the-art process used for developing the Alexa wake word and deployed through the high-accuracy Alexa wake word engine. To create natural voice responses, each brand can choose their own unique voice. Alexa's voice science experts will guide them throughout the recording process and develop the voice using advanced machine learning algorithms. Finally, developers can leverage Alexa’s pre-built capabilities such as local search, weather, timers, and alarms, to further accelerate time to market.
By reducing the burden of building the core capabilities of an intelligent assistant, companies can focus their time and resources on creating unique capabilities that delight their customers. The Alexa Custom Assistant makes this easy by enabling developers to leverage the familiar Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) technology to build bespoke capabilities tailored to their brand and accessed through a unique wake word. For example, custom skills could be used to control a device like increasing the incline on a treadmill, changing the channel on a set top box, or starting a robot vacuum. They can also automate and scale customer interactions, such as providing troubleshooting guidance and helping customers learn more about device capabilities. This robust development environment allows each Alexa Custom Assistant implementation to be tailored to the individual brand, product, and customer needs. 
Better Together: Cooperating to delight customers
A unique feature of the Alexa Custom Assistant is that it allows the brand’s assistant and Alexa to cooperate to fulfill the customer’s request. This feature is enabled by advanced AI to ensure each request is routed to the assistant that can provide the most relevant and delightful experience. For example, if a customer asks Alexa to roll down a car window, or how to troubleshoot a device, the request will be routed to the brand’s assistant. If a customer asks the brand’s assistant to play an audio book, the request will be routed to Alexa. Alexa’s presence alongside the brand’s assistant also provides customers access to tens of thousands of Alexa skills and integrations such as smart home, entertainment, trivia & games, shopping, food & drinks, mobility services, and many others. Further, because the Alexa Custom Assistant is built from the ground up with privacy in mind and using Alexa technology, Amazon manages the data and applies the same rigorous privacy and security policies in place for Alexa. The result is a convenient and intuitive experience that provides the combined benefits of both assistants to deepen customer engagement across their digital lives.
What others have to say about Alexa Custom Assistant
""Voice Assistants have become a critical piece of the in-vehicle customer experience, and automotive manufacturers are increasingly looking for opportunities to differentiate using this channel,” said Matt Arcaro, Senior Industry Analyst, Digital Automotive and Transportation Strategies, IDC. “However, many manufacturers struggle to balance the investments needed to develop, deliver, and maintain a best-in-class voice experience for their vehicles. This has opened the door for popular voice assistant to invest in productizing their technology, capabilities, and reach so that manufacturers can leverage this foundation to build a full-featured, yet, customizable voice assistant. The Alexa Custom Assistant appears well positioned to meet these needs. IDC sees the continued evolution of voice assistant offerings as a positive for automotive manufacturers, especially with helping them maximize resources, agility, and time to market, without compromising the customer experience.”
Global availability starting today
The Alexa Custom Assistant is available starting today anywhere Alexa is supported: U.S., Canada, U.K., Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, Japan, India, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and Brazil, with additional countries to follow.

Now Available: Enable Your Customers to Track and Manage their Devices’ Energy Usage with the Alexa Energy Dashboard ;Thu Jan 14 15:35:00 UTC 2021;Ben Grossman;"In September, we announced the new Alexa energy dashboard, accessed through the Alexa app, that gives customers a single place to track and manage the estimated energy consumed by their compatible Alexa-connected smart home devices. Today, we are excited to announce you can now integrate your compatible lights, switches, plugs, TVs, water heaters, and thermostat devices with the new energy dashboard, with support for more devices available in the coming months. You can now use new APIs to proactively report your device’s energy consumption to Alexa, or let Alexa estimate the energy used by your devices. Plus, if Alexa has a Hunch that a customer is away and forgot to turn off a light, you can enable Alexa to automatically turn it off with Hunches —helping your customers conserve energy without even thinking about it.

By integrating Alexa’s energy dashboard, you can make your existing and new devices smarter and more appealing to an increasing number of customers who are looking to make their homes more sustainable. Customers can see if your device supports the energy dashboard on the Amazon.com energy dashboard webpage and on your product’s detail page, differentiating your product and building confidence that they can track and save on energy usage. With the energy dashboard, we aim to make it easier to make a positive impact on the planet and we invite you to join us in making a difference together. Start integrating today.
You can now integrate your devices with the energy dashboard in two ways: You can either report the energy consumed by your devices directly to Alexa, or you can enable Alexa to estimate the energy consumed by your devices by providing the required power metadata (e.g. wattage for lights) for your device. Based on your device type and energy reporting capabilities, you can implement one of the new APIs below.

Report Your Device's Energy Consumption to Alexa
You can now proactively report the energy consumed by your compatible devices to Alexa using the new Alexa.DeviceUsage.Meter.API. Alexa will then show the cumulative energy usage data to your customers by day, week, or a month on the energy dashboard. This new API allows you to specify the unit of measure (e.g. WATT_HOUR, BTU), the frequency of reporting energy consumption data (up to once a day), and specify if the energy reported is an estimate or an actual reading tracked by the device. Aquanta, Awair, Rheem, and TP-Link will be among the first to report energy consumption data for smart lights, smart plugs, and water heaters by integrating with energy dashboard in the coming months.

Let Alexa Estimate Your Device’s Energy Consumption for You
For devices such as smart lights and TVs, you can let Alexa estimate your device’s energy consumption and show customers estimated energy consumption in the dashboard. To enable Alexa energy estimates for your devices you can now use the Alexa.DeviceUsage.Estimation API to report the required power rating metadata such as On & Off wattage to Alexa as part of your device’s discovery response. Alexa will use your state and change reports to determine how long a device has been on and combine this with the power metadata you provide to estimate your device’s energy consumption in the Alexa app. For example, when combining On wattage for smart lights with the PowerController, BrightnessController, and ColorTemperature change reports, Alexa will determine the amount of time the light was on and estimate the energy it consumed.

Additionally, for smart lights, switches, and plugs used to control lights, and TVs that already report state changes for the Alexa PowerController API proactively via state and change reporting, your customers can simply enter the required power metadata directly in the Alexa app to start tracking the estimated energy used on your device. This is particularly useful for switches and plugs that don’t have energy monitoring capabilities and also don’t know the power rating (e.g. wattage) of the device they control. Phillips, Hisense, Tuya, LIFX, Sengled, eWelink and Alea Labs will be using energy estimation for their devices that don't currently support energy tracking.
For smart thermostats, you can now use the new Alexa.ThermostatController.HVAC.Components API to send Alexa change reports that include On/Off states and time stamps for each of the heating and cooling elements that your thermostats control. Alexa uses this component level data along with customer inputs, such as approximate square footage of their home, to estimate the energy consumed by the Heating and Cooling system controlled by the thermostat. Join brands like Resideo’s Honeywell Home Solutions and Emerson who are offering this capability to their customers.

Now Available: Enable Alexa to Proactively Act on Hunches Without Customers Needing to Ask;Thu Dec 10 09:13:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"In September, we announced new experiences to make the Alexa-enabled smart home even more natural and proactive. Today, we are excited to announce you can now enable Alexa to proactively act on Hunches without customers needing to ask. If you are a smart light, plug, or switch manufacturer, Alexa will automatically support Hunches for your devices using your existing Smart Home Skill API integration. If you make thermostats, you can now use the new Alexa.AutomationManagement API to enable proactive automation via Hunches.

With Hunches, your new and existing devices become even smarter with Alexa and more useful for your customers with little to no added development effort. Customers can choose to have Alexa proactively control their compatible devices, such as automatically turning off their lights or adjusting their thermostat temperature when Alexa has a hunch they are away from the home or asleep. That means customers have fewer things to think about when at home or away so they can spend their time on more meaningful things.
If you already have a smart home skill for your lights, plugs, and switches, there is little to no extra development effort you need to do to enable Hunches. With Hunches, Alexa leverages the Alexa PowerController API via your smart home skill to help customers automate their home and reduce energy consumption by automatically turning off the lights that are accidentally left on when Alexa has a hunch that no one is home. Alexa can generate hunches by learning from customers’ usage patterns, such as when they speak to Alexa and when they interact with your smart home devices, enabled by your device’s state and change reporting that you already share with Alexa. When you report your device’s state and changes to Alexa, you also make Alexa and Hunches smarter by keeping Alexa informed when your device is turned on and off, delivering better experiences for customers. Higher quality reports enable better Hunches and customer experiences. Smart light manufacturers such as Philips Hue, TP-Link, LIFX, Sengled, Wemo, eWeLink, IKEA and more are have enabled Hunches to proactively help their customers.
Thermostat manufacturers like Resideo’s Honeywell Home solutions already use the Alexa.ThermostatController.SetTargetTemperature directive to enable customers to control their smart thermostat with their voice. With Hunches, Alexa can now help your customers save energy by using these same SetTargetTemperature directives to proactively set the thermostat to your customer’s preferred away or sleep temperatures when Alexa has a Hunch they are away or asleep.
If your device already supports existing automation capabilities, such as a smart thermostat, you can now integrate the new Alexa.AutomationManagement API to coordinate when Alexa Hunches or your device controls automation. When you implement the AutomationManagement interface, Alexa notifies you when the customer opts in to use Hunches to automate their device via the Alexa app, and you notify Alexa via a ChangeReport when the customer wants to use your existing automation to control their device, such as setting a temperature schedule in your companion app. This minimizes scheduling conflicts and provides a consistent experience, helping your customers know if you or Alexa are controlling their device actions and how their feature choices change their device’s behavior. 

To help customers know whether your device or Alexa Hunches control automation, you will need to update your product experience. This will ensure customers are always aware of how their device is operating. For example, Resideo’s Honeywell Home solutions has integrated the Alexa.AutomationManagement API to coordinate when to turn off their thermostats’ schedule and geofence features in their companion app and to indicate that the thermostat is using Alexa Hunches. They also inform customers who are trying to create custom automations in their companion app, such as a temperature schedules, that doing so will disable Hunches. If a customer chooses to enable Resideo’s thermostat schedule, Alexa Hunches will be disabled to ensure the customer’s feature choice is selected.
You can now enable Alexa to proactively turn on your water heater’s energy saving mode when Alexa has a hunch that customers are away. Manufactures of water heaters and water heater controllers such as Aquanta already use Alexa’s ToggleController to enable customers to turn on their water heater energy saving mode using their voice. Manufactures may use different names for their water heaters’ energy saver modes, such as “eco”, “energy saver”, “away mode”, and more. Now, you can enable Hunches for your specific energy saver mode using new semantic extensions by updating the Alexa Discovery response for your existing ToggleController and ModeController capabilities. You specify a semantics state mapping of Alexa.States.EnergySaver to indicate the Toggle/Mode Controller instance that represents your energy saving mode. For example, if you use the ToggleController capability, Alexa uses the state mapping to send you a TurnOn directive corresponding to your specific energy saving mode when Alexa has a hunch that no one is home. Similarly, Alexa will disable the energy saving mode by sending a TurnOff directive when Alexa has a Hunch that your customer’s home is occupied.
If your device support existing automation, you can learn more about how to get started with Hunches by viewing the AutomationManagement API documentation below.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/12/Enable-Alexa-to-Proactively-Act-on-Hunches;
Now Available: Use the Smart Home Live Debugger Tool to Test, Debug, and Speed Up Your Camera WebRTC Integration;Fri Dec 04 10:42:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"Smart Home camera developers love providing real-time streaming capabilities that are secure and fast (low latency) to their customers. Smart Home Cameras’ Alexa.RTCSessionController interface enables developers to provide live streaming, 2-way communication, Automatic Live View and other experiences to their customers. Today, we are excited to introduce Smart Home Live Debugger support for Alexa.RTCSessionController integration, making it easier and faster for more camera manufacturers to test and debug their WebRTC implementation, and reducing time to market for new features. Blink, Scout Alarm and Netatmo will be among the first to use Smart Home Live Debugger to support their Alexa WebRTC integration process.

Test Your WebRTC Integration With Real-Time Debugging Tools
The Smart Home Live Debugger tool in the Alexa Developer Console can help you quickly test your WebRTC integration by surfacing events generated by the interaction of your Alexa skill with Smart Home Cameras’ signaling and streaming services. This can help address common challenge areas for WebRTC in (1) Signaling: issues with the SDP answer, incompatible DTLS version, invalid or missing ICE candidates, errors in Lambda communication, and (2) Media Streaming: Supported or unsupported codecs, state of media flow etc.

To use the Smart Home Live Debugger tool with Alexa.RTCSessionController, go to the ""Test"" page in the Alexa Developer Console, then at the top of the page select ""Device Log"" and enable the Smart Home Live Debugger toggle to create a new session.
To generate events, you will need to first set up a client, such as an Echo device with a screen, and link your skill with Alexa. Then, when you use an utterance, such as “Alexa, show me the front door camera”, you will immediately see events published in the device logs section for each step, starting from the utterance to when you start seeing the live view on the Echo device. You can then dive deeper into these events, such as viewing detailed JSON objects to check responses and troubleshoot issues or exceptions, with all critical and sensitive information, such as customer IDs, filtered out. The JSON objects will contain appropriate error codes and messages to help you narrow down issues and potentially confine them to a focused area for further troubleshooting, so it does not feel like you are integrating and testing against a black box.
Reduce Time to Market from Months to a Few weeks
Whether you are an established brand or a start up, you can use the Smart Home Live Debugger to reduce the time to launch an Alexa Smart Home skill and get your product Works with Alexa (WWA) certified. With this self-service tool, you can independently debug issues from anywhere in the world.
Netatmo, who recently released their first WebRTC compatible Smart Video Doorbell, is excited to use the tool to assist their integration efforts, “Debugging a WebRTC integration could previously be challenging without being able to know where things were going wrong. We are looking forward to using the new Smart Home Live Debugger tool to help us accelerate our Smart Video Doorbell integration with Alexa.” said Christophe Puga, lead software engineer from Netatmo.

Introducing Camera Smart Alerts (Preview): Enable Computer Vision-based Alerts When a Person is Detected on Your Camera Devices;Thu Dec 03 20:55:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"Customers want their smart home devices to do more for them. Millions of customers already use Alexa camera features like Live View and 2-way communication to give them greater security and peace of mind. We’re building new computer vision (CV)-based experiences to make your camera devices even more proactive, helpful, and better with Alexa. Today, we are excited to announce the developer preview of Camera Smart Alerts in the US, a new CV-based feature to provide your customers actionable notifications via Alexa and your native app when a person is detected on their smart home cameras. Existing camera motion alerts can be too frequent, without context, and prone to false alerts. Camera Smart Alerts cuts down unhelpful notification noise by only alerting your customers when someone enters the camera view, without individually identifying any specific person.

For developers, we make it easy to integrate Camera Smart Alerts, whether or not you already have a CV solution. We’re excited to announce you can leverage Alexa’s new cloud-based CV service to quickly broaden your feature offering to all your customers, without needing to invest in and build your own CV solution or machine learning models. You can also choose to use your existing CV solution if you have one. Sign up today to learn more and get started with Camera Smart Alerts.
With Camera Smart Alerts, your camera experience gets better with Alexa, opening more opportunities to sell your cameras to the millions of existing customers with Alexa devices. When a person is detected on your cameras, your customers can enable Alexa to make voice announcements on their Echo devices such as “Person detected at the front door”, display live video on their Echo devices with screens, and send smart alerts via the Alexa app. Once enabled, you decide how to offer Camera Smart Alerts capabilities to your customers, such as including them within your existing or new subscription plans, or at no cost. You can further promote person detection capabilities on your Amazon product pages, packaging, and other marketing materials to differentiate your camera devices.
There are two ways to integrate Camera Smart Alerts for all your customers: You can use Alexa’s CV service or choose to use your existing CV solution if you have one.

Leverage Alexa’s Cloud-Based Service For Your Computer Vision Processing
If you don’t have an existing CV processing solution, there is no need to invest the time and money in building a team of data scientists and machine learning models. You can use Alexa’s new cloud-based CV service to handle CV processing on your smart home cameras, enabling Camera Smart Alerts experiences for all your customers in your app and via Alexa. We've designed this service to perform best with smart home use cases. CV processing is done in real-time on your cameras’ streams, honoring any zones or pre-filtering done by the camera, without any humans in the loop or storing any videos or audio. As a cloud-based solution, the Alexa CV service will continue to improve over time without requiring your intervention or on-device changes, making it easier for you to offer new delightful customer experiences for your customers. Camera Smart Alerts also supports CV verdict data sharing, enabling you to build complementary experiences in your apps and on your camera devices to further improve your customer experience. You receive metadata back after computer vision processing, such as the detection status (for example, a person is detected), image uri, and timestamp of the event in order to enable Camera Smart Alerts.

Brands like Abode are among the first to use Alexa’s CV service to offer Camera Smart Alerts for their customers. “By leveraging Alexa’s computer vision service, we were able to quickly enable our customers to get even more proactive and contextual experiences out of their Abode cameras without needing to reinvent the wheel and develop our own computer vision models,” says Scott Beck, Abode CTO.

For camera manufacturers, choosing to leverage Alexa’s in-house service for your computer vision processing requires a licensing fee billed per camera per month. To onboard, you need to have a smart home skill that supports the existing Smart Home Camera APIs and your cameras must use WebRTC streaming, enabled through integration with Alexa.RTCSessionController Interface. Camera streams must support video codecs of H264 (up to profile high, level 4.1) and a minimum resolution of 720p. To ensure the high privacy bar for our customers, you are are also required to support end-to-end encryption and two-step verification for customer onboarding.

Use Your Existing CV Solution
Beginning early next year, you can also enable Camera Smart Alerts using your own CV processing if you have an existing solution, making your cameras more useful and attractive to the millions of Alexa customers. You simply integrate with the Camera Smart Alerts API, available soon to preview participants, to pass metadata to Amazon to enable Camera Smart Alerts experiences in the Alexa app and on Echo devices. No licensing fee is required, you just cover your ongoing CV processing costs. Once you integrate, your customers can opt into Camera Smart Alerts for your smart home cameras in the Alexa app.
Camera Smart Alerts are designed to protect customer privacy, and we want customers and device manufactures to have the assurance that their data is secure. Camera Smart Alert protections include:


CV processing is done without any humans in the loop or storing any videos or audio, keeping your customers’ data and privacy safe and secure.
Whether customers use your native app or connect their cameras to Alexa, the Camera Smart Alerts feature is disabled by default and customers will need to set up the experience for each camera in your native app and the Alexa app.
Customers can easily adjust their settings at any time and can choose to turn off Camera Smart Alerts for each of their compatible cameras, such as turning person detection on or off for specific cameras, turning Alexa app notifications off if they only wish to receive mobile notifications only from your native app, or selecting specific Echo devices for camera announcements.
Customers can review or clear their Smart Alerts history anytime in the Alexa App, or use a single click un-enroll option in the Alexa app to turn off Camera Smart Alerts for all their cameras, which deletes all images from their Smart Alert history.

You can read more FAQs here to learn about the many privacy and security protections built into Camera Smart Alerts.

Managing AVS Device SDK components with Manufactory;Tue Dec 01 17:07:00 UTC 2020;Sam Schonstal;"The AVS Device SDK introduced a new framework to simplify integration tasks named Manufactory. Manufactory makes it easier to add, remove, and customize SDK components without digging into the core SDK code. Version 1.21 of the SDK now includes a preview application that demonstrates building an Alexa application using Manufactory. This initial release of Manufactory gives you an idea of what's to come in the next few SDK releases. It includes a preview sample application that will evolve over time, and should stabilize by the summer of 2021. This blog outlines how Manufactory works, the reasoning behind the changes, and provides a glimpse of future AVS Device SDK changes.
Over the last three years, the SDK has grown significantly. Version 1.0, released in August 2017, supported five capability agents and was less the 150k lines of code. Version 1.20, released in June 2020, supports 14 Capability Agents and is over 480k lines of code. With this growth, we realized that we needed to make customization and integration of the SDK easier.
The SDK is adaptable. You are free to add, remove, or customize components to suit your needs. Currently, the SDK uses dependency injection to pass objects created by the application into the SDK core. The default client consumes these objects and orchestrates the distribution throughout the SDK. In version 1.20, the DefaultClient::create() function takes 58 input parameters. The application must create and initialize all of these objects, which leads to increased complexity and integration challenges.
The SDK consists of the following categories of components.

Core components, such as the Directive Sequencer and the Focus Manager, are essential for Alexa interaction and should not be removed or modified.
Optional components, such as Smart Home endpoints or Display Cards, to implement features you might not support on your device and can removed without disrupting the SDK's core functionality.
External components, such as Alexa Calling and Messaging or Multi-Room Music, aren't included by default and require special qualifications to be added.
Other features, such as media players, wake-word engines or authentication methods, have several different implementations to choose from. The SDK provides sample implementations, but you will likely need to customize or replace them for your finished product

Manufactory allows you to select which components you want to add to your device and simplifies the task of adding and removing features or replacing the sample implementations. Componentization is a cleaner way to customize device configuration and improves maintainability by making it easier to upgrade core SDK components. For example, you can update the device SDK core components without having to modify your application.
We started adding Manufactory to the SDK in version 1.20. With Manufactory, you don't need to know the details of the component you want to use – you simply request one from Manufactory and use it. Manufactory creates and initializes objects, handles dependencies and manages the lifecycle of these objects. It automates and abstracts this logic from you, eliminating any complex logic required to initialize components in the application. The diagram below illustrates the basic structure of Manufactory.
Figure 1 Structure of manufactory
 
When you create a Manufactory, you pass it a component. A component is a collection of factories used to create the objects supporting the application. Manufactory creates and manages these objects.
Manufactory exposes a get<>()method. The application can request an object by invoking get<>() with the desired object type. To do this, Manufactory first checks its object cache to see if it has the proper type to return. If it doesn't already have one in its cache, Manufactory invokes the appropriate factory to create the object.
To use Manufactory in your application, follow these steps
Provide a factory function for your object
Define a component
 Add your factory to the component
Create a Manufactory using that component
 Acquire objects from the Manufactory
To manage an object with Manufactory, the defining class
must:



Implement the factory pattern with a static
create function 
Return a Standard lib std::shared_ptr
or std::unique_pt
Input parameters must be of types that are accessible
to the Manufactory

For example, this class provides a factory function that creates and returns a pointer to an Audioplayer.
Note: I simplified the code in this blog for brevity. Some namespaces and declarations are removed. The intention is to illustrate the principles of Manufactory. For accurate compliable code, see the AVS Device SDK on GitHub.
Manufactory relies on C++ templates for type checking and resolving dependencies. This means Components must specify the C++ Types they export. A Component is a templated Type unique to the Types in its declaration. When declaring a Component, specify all the Types the Component will export to Manufactory—for example, the following SampleAlexaComponent is a unique Type of a Component that exports an AudioPlayer, SpeakerInterface, UIManager, ConfigurationNode and an AuthDelegateInterface.
A factory must be available to the Component to create each of the declared types, or compilation will fail.  The Component can, however, hide some types. It can have factories for types used internally that are not exported.
You can build Components from other components, so a parent component can create objects and inject them into the child components that need them. For this process, Components can specify Imports. These imports can be used as input parameters to other factory functions, but they must be available from a parent Component.
The following example shows an AuthorizationDelegateComponent that exports an AuthDelegateInterface, but requires a CBLAuthRequesterInterface, ConfigurationNode, and HttpPostInterface. The AuthorizationDelegateComponent can't be created independently, but it can be included as a part of a parent component that can fulfill these import dependencies.
The ComponentAccumulator class builds Components. It has functions to add various types of objects. Each of these functions returns a ComponentAccumulator so they can be chained together. In the end, the ComponentAccumulator is converted into a Component that is passed to Manufactory. The example below shows a component that satisfies the exports declared by the SampleAlexaComponent declared earlier.
In this example, we create the SampleAlexaComponent Component. To do this, several different types of factories and components are added together using the ComponentAccumulator.  Descriptions of these items are listed below.

 addPrimaryFactory() – Primary Factories are instantiated by Manufactory before anything else. This occurs when the Manufactory is initially created. Here we add, AlexaClientSDKInit.
addComponent() – takes a component as an input parameter. The AudioPlayer and speakerManager are required to satisfy exports declared by SampleAlexaComponent. The acsdkShared component exports the ConfigurationNode and HttpPostInterface to meet the import requirements for the AuthorizationDelegateComponent declared earlier.
addUnloadableFactory() – Unloadable factories are for objects that Manufactory can unload from memory when all references to the pointer are released. The createCBLAuthRequestedInterface exports the CBLAuthRequesterInterface, which is also needed by the AuthorizationDelegateComponent.
addRetainedFactory() – Retained factories tell the Manufactory to keep that object alive as long as the Manufactory is running. The UIManager should always be running.

Note that other 'add' functions are available to add non-shareable objects, object instances, and more. For more details, see the AVS Device SDK on GitHub and the API references.
To create a Manufactory, call the Manufactory create<>() method and pass in the component you wish to use. The only catch is the Manufactory must declare all the Types it exports, and all those Types must be available for export by the Component used to create that Manufactory. The declaration below is almost identical to the Component declaration, except we chose not to export the authentication delegate.
Manufactory creates and manages the objects defined in the components it houses. When the application needs an object, it calls the appropriate templated get<>() function on the manufactory instance to acquire a pointer to the object. Manufactory either returns a pointer to an existing object or creates a new one—whatever is appropriate for that object type. In the example below, we acquired a pointer to an instance of the UImanager and use that instance to configure notifications settings.
Manufactory allows you to pick and choose which components you want to use in your application. You can start with the AlexaClientComponent in the Preview Alexa Client of the AVS Device SDK and add or remove optional components. Some optional components are wrapped in an #ifdef tag in the Preview Alexa Client, allowing addition of the component code with compiler flags demonstrating this flexibility.
It's also straightforward to replace an implementation. For example, you might replace the authorization delegate to use an application-based authentication instead of the Code Based Authentication. To do this, simply replace the factory method passed to addFactory(). As long as it supports the same AuthDelegate interface, no other code in the application needs to change.
The only change required to support MyNewUIManager, other than writing MyNewUIManager, is changing the factory passed to the component through the addRetainedFactory() method. Nothing else in the application needs to change to adapt to the new implementation.
Manufactory is a significant change to the AVS Device SDK. We added some of these changes in version 1.20 of the SDK. To minimize churn over the next several releases, we added a preview client. The Preview Alexa Client, found under avs-device-sdk/applications, gives you a sneak peek into the Manufactory implementation. Note that the Preview Alexa Client will change dramatically as the implementation evolves. Consider the preview client as an 'alpha' release for you to follow along. As of this writing, it's not recommended to use the previewAlexaClient for production. If you want to build the preview application in version 1.21, Run CMake as you usually would then run 'make PreviewAlexaClient'.
The current Sample Application relies on the default client. The 58 input parameters to the DefaultClient::create()function are initialized in the sample application making the sampleApplication.cpp file 1769 lines long. From version 1.20 going forward, this Sample Application will not change much. We will only update the Sample Application to support new Alexa features. We will not make any more changes to the Sample Application to support Manufactory. The changes to support Manufactory are going to be made in the default client.
Figure 2 Legacy
application


 
In the transition phase, there will be both a Sample application, and its replacement, Preview Alexa Client. The sample application will behave the same way as the legacy application. However, the new Preview Application will use Manufactory to initialize objects. It will pass the Manufactory to a new overloaded create() function in the Default client, which will get the objects from the manufactory and pass them to the rest of the application.
Figure 3 Transition phase
 
Ultimately, the sample app will be eliminated and default client will be replaced by a simpler ‘Alexa Client’ with a single run() function taking one parameter, Manufactory. Manufactory will also be available to the Application to allow access to objects for customization purposes and to interface with any external device components.
Figure 4 Future Vision
Use the Preview Application to explore and follow along as the SDK evolves. While the actual implementation of Manufactory is quite complex, using it is relatively straightforward. You simply pass your objects to Manufactory through components and then use them. As we streamline the interfaces and evolve the implementation, customizing the SDK will become even more manageable.  Over the next several releases, you will see additional changes to add modularization and customization to the SDK until we stabilize the implementation in mid-2021. So, don't worry, you don't have to consume any of it yet. The Preview Application is there for you to explore, and we will maintain the current Sample Application as-is for all of 2021. The Preview Application will become the primary Sample Application in 2022.
 
The AVS Device SDK team is dedicated to helping you easily build Alexa devices. We do this by continuing to iterate on a robust solution that is reliable, customizable and easy to maintain.

Best Practices to Reduce Latency on your Smart Home Skill;Fri Nov 20 06:30:00 UTC 2020;Michael Williams;"When it comes to your Alexa skill, speed matters. When customers use your skill to control their smart home devices, they expect her to respond quickly. If your skill has high latency, this can lead to a loss of customer engagement and low ratings.  Below are 9 recommendations to help improve the performance of your smart home skill.
1.      Adjust your Skill Lambda function memory allocation to a minimum of 512MB RAM: Allocating more memory (MB) will provide more CPU power to your Lambda function and will execute faster. For smart home skills, we recommend you to allocate at least 512MB RAM to your Skill Lambda function.
To further optimize your memory allocation, you can:
a)  Analyze the max memory used on your skill: You can analyze the memory used by your Alexa skill in your AWS CloudWatch Logs. By analyzing the “Max Memory Used” field, you can determine if your function needs more memory or if you over-provisioned your function's memory size. On each skill invocation, a “REPORT” entry will be made to your CloudWatch logs, as shown below: 

REPORT RequestId: 3604209a-e9a3-11e6-939a-754dd98c7be3 Duration: 12.34 ms Billed Duration: 100 ms Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 18 MB
b)  Load test your Lambda function: To determine an optimum timeout and memory values, it is important to analyze how long your function runs. This will allow you to discover any dependency issues your function may be running into while waiting for a response from a service, which may be increasing the concurrency of the function beyond what you expect. This is especially important when your Lambda function makes network calls to resources that may not handle Lambda's scaling. You can learn more about scaling here.
 
2.      Identify and fix control errors that are causing high latency: Using CloudWatch metrics you can dig deeper into lambda requests that are failing. If a lambda request fails, this can cause Alexa to wait 8 seconds before Alexa responds back to customer. This not only affects your overall skill latency but also causes slow response time to customers. To see a breakdown of your success and failures, select the Monitoring tab inside your lambda window:
You can identify at particular time intervals where requests are failing, and then dig even further through CloudWatch logs to see why these failed.
3.      Ensure no synchronous database calls are done before response to Alexa: For example, avoid updating databases before responding to Alexa as both should be done asynchronously. If these calls are left synchronous prior to responding to Alexa, it will delay response to Alexa, and in turn the customer.


4.      Avoid cross-region calls: We recommend placement of Lambda functions and media services in additional regions based on geographic distances contributing to latency and regions supported by the Alexa Service. At the very minimum, if you serve in NA & EU, your AWS should support 3 regions: N. Virginia (us-east-1), Dublin (eu-west-1), Oregon (us-west-2). The list of all supported regions for Lambda can be found on the AWS website. Distance between services is a contributing factor for latency, it is important to keep http calls within region to reduce latency.


5.      Optimize Amazon Simple Queue Service values: If you are using Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) as an event source, make sure the value of the function's expected execution time does not exceed the Visibility Timeout value on the queue. This applies both to CreateFunction and UpdateFunctionConfiguration. AWS terminates every function exceeding its configured timeout so utterances will fail incorrectly.


6.      Implement Wake-On-Lan Controller for AV devices: Standby mode for AV devices such as TVs can take a long time to wake up the device before invoking a command which causes latency. Implementing Wake-On-LAN controller will power on the devices in low power mode and when an Alexa request is sent to you, you can decide whether you want to wake up the device using your cloud or you want Alexa to execute the request using the WoL protocol.

Inside every Alexa Smart Home architecture, the AWS lambda instance can be another source of latency and control errors. The following recommendations can help reduce the latency caused by your Lambda.

7.      Take advantage of execution context reuse to improve the performance of your function: Starting-up the Execution Context can take some time but is inevitable before running the function for the first time, this is known as the ""cold start"". The very first time your Lambda function is invoked, you have to wait for ""bootstrapping"" to complete. 

Initialize SDK clients and database connections outside of the function handler, and cache static assets locally in the /tmp directory. Subsequent invocations processed by the same instance of your function can reuse these resources. This saves execution time and cost. To avoid potential data leaks across invocations, don’t use the execution context to store user data, events, or other information with security implications. If your function relies on a mutable state that can’t be stored in memory within the handler, consider creating a separate function or separate versions of a function for each user. You can learn more about lambda best practices here.
 
8.      Minimize the complexity of your dependencies: Simpler frameworks will load more quickly on the Execution Context startup. You can simplify your Lambda by:

Using Java dependency injection (IoC) frameworks like Dagger or Guice, over more complex ones like Spring Framework.
Ensuring you are using most current versions of packages.
Packaging your function into a JAR which will result in a function of a few KB's.
Deleting unused lambdas to avoid dead code inflating deployment package size.

 
9.      Ensure that your Lambda has no recursive code: Recursive code can lead to unintended volume of function invocations and escalated costs.

Frustration-Free Setup Expands Features, Protocols, and Simplifies Onboarding;Thu Sep 24 18:33:00 UTC 2020;Quentin Robinson;"Today, we're excited to announce updates to Frustration-Free Setup (FFS), including wifi simple reconnect (preview), the general availability of Bluetooth simple setup, and new FFS solution providers to help you get your device to market quickly. 

FFS enables you to simplify the connection of your devices to your customer's network and Alexa account. We've seen multiple device brands launch products with wifi simple setup, including TP-Link, Lifx, Wemo, Tuya, and Brother since launching last year. Today, we're excited to announce several new features, including a preview of wifi simple reconnect, a new feature to simplify reconnecting your device to a customer's router. Next, we're announcing the general availability of Bluetooth simple setup (BSS), a simple way for your devices to connect to your customer's network upon plugin. Finally, we're excited to share there are now several solution providers with wifi simple setup pre-integrated and pre-certified so you can accelerate time-to-market.
Wifi simple reconnect aims to simplify updating network credentials for a customer’s compatible smart devices. As a customer, updating all your connected devices’ wifi credentials can be a painful experience when moving to a new building, changing internet service providers, or simply updating wifi passwords for security reasons. Changing the wifi network name and password is even more complicated for screenless devices, such as smart switches, lamps, and vacuum cleaners. In some cases, customers have to factory reset their devices to put them into a pairing mode and re-add the device with a mobile application. Now, with wifi simple reconnect, your devices can talk to other compatible devices to keep wifi information in sync. This creates a way for smart home devices to interact with one another when they need help reconnecting to the network.

How it works
A wifi simple reconnect compatible device, such as the latest generation of Echo and Fire TV devices, use beacons to alert other compatible devices in range when it needs help or has a network disruption event. Distress events include network connectivity losses specific to password changes or the inability to find a network name. Other connectivity events such as loss between the router and ISP (limited connectivity), DNS, and VPN issues will not count as a disrupted event. A customer's Alexa app can detect these distress events, prompt the customer to update credentials, and share the credentials securely over Bluetooth to your device. Once this device comes online, it can then assist other distressed devices on the customer's account and in-range to come back online, if the customer granted permission. In most cases, a customer only has to update their new network name or password once through the Alexa app, and wifi simple reconnect takes care of the rest.

How to get started
Wifi simple reconnect will be available with the latest generation of Echo and Fire TV devices next month. Wifi simple reconnect will launch with Eaton wifi smart devices early next year and will be generally available for all device makers soon after. We’re excited to help your devices get and stay connected so customers can experience less frustration. You can request access to the wifi simple reconnect preview here.
Bluetooth simple setup (BSS) connects compatible devices purchased on Amazon.com to a customer's network automatically upon power-up. This new simple setup protocol is now generally available to start integration and will be available for customers with the launch of new Echo Show devices next month. This new protocol uses Bluetooth Mesh as a standards-based protocol to simplify onboarding for customers, making the setup of Bluetooth-enabled devices as easy as plugging it in. With Bluetooth simple setup, there are no SDKs to integrate. Start integrating by reviewing our documentation in the FFS console, and with our new manufacturing tools, you can have your device shipping to customers in just a few weeks.

How it works
Bluetooth simple setup (BSS) leverages Bluetooth Mesh as the foundational protocol, so you'll need to integrate it before integrating FFS. Next, to register your device with a customer after purchase, we'll need to know the unique serial number from your device. During manufacturing, you can send us these serial numbers in the form of a control log, which we use to authorize and authenticate your device with our backend. This serial number must also be on your packaging, so when the packaging is scanned in our fulfillment center, we can associate your device to the customer's account. Once the customer unboxes and powers on your device, it will emit a setup beacon discovered by our BLE Mesh capable hubs. These hubs then share an install code for your device to join the network. Your customers can also use directives such as ""Alexa, Discover my Devices"" to start the Bluetooth simple setup workflow.

How to get started
To get started, head over to our Bluetooth simple setup tech documentation here.
We are excited to announce two new simplifiers for bringing FFS-enabled products to the market. First, you can now reduce your time-to-market by using pre-integrated and certified off-the-shelf products from solution providers, like Tuya, eWeLink, and Tonly. These solution providers manage manufacturing, certification, badging, and scale your new product globally to several Amazon marketplaces. Next, if you are building your FFS-enabled device from scratch, we now have integration reference designs and tools to simplify manufacturing. Each reference design has sample apps with tech docs that can be copied into your projects.

You can also use packages such as Amazon Common Software (ACS) and Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) to speed up integration. ACS integrates multiple device SDKs and their software dependencies into one package. The Alexa Connect Kit, which allows you to build products at a fixed per-device cost, comes pre-integrated with FFS. By using either ACS or ACK, your device can use a streamlined FFS certification process, reducing complexity and time-to-market.

How to get started

New Smart Home Tools and Metrics to Debug, Test, and Manage the Performance of Your Smart Home Skills;Thu Sep 24 18:30:00 UTC 2020;Sumit Dang;"The Smart Home Skill API allows you to build and connect virtually any device to Alexa. Thanks to your help, there are now over 140,000 smart home products connected to Alexa, and customers are using Alexa to control smart devices hundreds of millions of times each week. We’ve launched a set of development, debugging, testing, and analytic tools to help you through the skill building process and to optimize your skill performance.
When implementing your skill, you will need to validate that your smart home skill is sending the right responses back to Alexa. You can now use the Smart Home schemas to validate your skill. These schemas can be used with any JSON Schema Validator and can help you validate and correct errors for any ""response"" JSON object for your Smart Home skills. To learn more about this tool and supported capabilities, visit the Alexa Smart Home GitHub.
During a skill implementation, you will often need to check to see whether your devices are changing to the right state. It can be difficult to verify device state with visual verification. For example, if you are implementing the BrightnessController interface for a smart light bulb, you may want to verify that your device is changing to the correct brightness percentage value when a customer says, “Alexa, turn the light to 50%”. This is hard to visually verify. Now, you can use the State Reporting Test Tool to verify the states for all your test Smart Home devices in your developer account. For more information on this tool, read the technical documentation here.

We also built the Smart Home Live Debugger tool to help you debug ChangeReport, AddOrUpdateReport, and DeleteReport events that Alexa receives from your skill. These events allow you to keep Alexa updated when a customer interacts with your device outside of Alexa, for example, turning on a smart light through a switch, or renaming a smart device through your app. These reports keep Alexa in sync with your device’s latest state change and help ensure a consistent customer experience. The Smart Home Live Debugger will debug asynchronous events that Alexa receives, including the JSON for your request and processing errors (if any) for those events. You can access the Smart Home Live Debugger under Test tab in the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) developer console or learn more about it here.
Now you can use Smart Home Tests tool to verify your lighting or thermostat device’s functionality before submitting it for Works with Alexa (WWA) Certification. We’ve added a set of automated tests in the Alexa Skills Kit developer console that will send directives to your skill and verify that it correctly sets the state of the device. With the Smart Home Test tool, you can reduce the time and cost to certify your device by quickly testing that your smart home skill is correctly handling Alexa directives for the capabilities it supports, reducing manual testing efforts and improving your skill’s quality. The tool currently provides automated tests for the following Alexa interfaces: BrightnessController, ColorController, ColorTemperatureController, PowerController, and ThermostatController. With the tool, you’ll be able to select a test device to run the automated tests against, download a summary report, and download detailed test execution results. To get started, read our documentation and navigate to the Test tab in the Alexa Skills Kit developer console.
To help you understand how end-users interact with your Alexa skill, we’ve built a set of usage metrics including latency and success rates for device discovery, device control, query state requests, and change reports. To view your skill metrics reports, visit the Analytics page in the Alexa Skills Kit developer console or read the technical documentation here. We also launched a new feature in the Analytics page that allows you to download message IDs and associated metadata such as latency, errors, and exceptions for skill failures which will help you you troubleshoot and solve issues that impact your customers. Learn more about downloading message IDs here.
You can debug, test, and improve your Alexa Smart Home skill today by accessing these smart home tools and metrics in the developer console, or learn more by visiting the technical documentation below:


Smart Home Debugger – View the ChangeReport, AddOrUpdateReport, and DeleteReport events that Alexa receives from your skill, including your JSON, and any processing errors.
Smart Home Test – Run automated tests that send directives to your skill and verify that you set the state correctly. Available for some of the most common Alexa interfaces.
State Reporting Test Tool – View the current values of all properties of smart home devices that are associated with your skill and your developer account, and whether the current value came from a StateReport request or proactive reporting such as a ChangeReport.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/09/New-Smart-Home-Tools-and-Metrics-to-Debug-Test-and-Manage-the-Performance-of-Your-Smart-Home-Skills;
Build a More Proactive and Intelligent Smart Home with Alexa;Thu Sep 24 11:39:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"Thanks to your efforts, Alexa now works with over 145,000 compatible products and customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Customers interact with your smart home devices every couple milliseconds, from controlling their connected homes to simplifying their daily routines. As Alexa’s intelligence advances, we’re inventing new experiences to make the smart home even more natural, convenient, and automated. Now, you can take advantage of new Alexa features to deliver more complete and proactive experiences for your customers.

Starting later this year, you can enable Alexa to proactively act on Hunches to help your customers automate their smart home and save energy. You can use some of the latest Smart Home Skill API updates to do things like enable customers to view and control your smart cameras from the Alexa app - including pan, tilt, and zoom - and to automatically re-order consumables based on inventory sensors. You can soon take advantage of new ways to connect your devices to Alexa, including using Bluetooth Mesh standard and Amazon Sidewalk. You can use local smart home skills to connect your devices locally to Echo devices and enable customers to control them at low latencies and when devices are offline. You can use the latest advancements in our Frustration Free Setup initiative like Bluetooth simple setup and Wi-Fi Simple Reconnect to make setting up and reconnecting devices even easier for customers. Finally, we continue to make it easier for customers to discover, learn about, and buy the great products you build on Amazon and other channels, and have expanded the Certified for Humans program to the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, and France, with even more countries coming soon.
Customers love controlling smart home devices with their voice, but with Alexa, you can do more than simply enable voice control. You can enable proactive and predictive experiences to help your customers save time and money, save energy, and make them feel safer and more secure.
Starting later this year, customers can choose to have Alexa proactively act on Hunches without needing to ask. For example, Alexa will proactively turn off the lights, adjust the thermostat, turn down the water heater, or start the robotic vacuum when Alexa has a hunch everyone is away or asleep. That means customers have fewer things to think about at home, so they can spend their time on more meaningful things. Alexa can generate these Hunches by learning customers typical usage patterns’ from when they speak to Alexa, and when they interact with their smart home devices, enabled by your device’s state and change reporting. When you report your device’s state and changes to Alexa, you also make Hunches better by keeping Alexa informed when your device is turned on and off, delivering better experiences for customers.

Manufacturers of smart lights, thermostats, and water heaters can enable proactive home automation, control, and personalization for customers through Hunches when it becomes available this year, with support for even more devices like robotic vacuums coming in early 2021. If you are a smart light and robotic vacuum developer, your devices will automatically support this feature using your existing Smart Home Skill API integration and state and change reporting. If you are a thermostat developer, you can start integrating and testing the new Alexa.AutomationManagement capability to enable the feature on your devices.

iRobot, Eufy, Rheem, Aquanta, and Resideo’s Honeywell Home Solutions are already integrating these features for their customers. You can learn more about how Hunches work in this blog and sign up here to be notified when more information is available.
As the number of devices in homes continues to increase, customers want to make sure their energy consumption is efficient and sustainable. Amazon has committed to achieving net zero carbon by 2040 as part of The Climate Pledge, and we are innovating new ways with Alexa to make it easier for everyone to participate in making a positive impact on the planet.

We are excited to announce the energy dashboard in the Alexa app, available in the US later this year, which will give your customers a single place to track and manage the energy consumption of their compatible Alexa smart home devices such as lights, plugs, switches, thermostats, TVs, water heaters, and Echo devices. Your customers can see how long their compatible devices have been on (hours) and the energy they consumed (kWh) by day, week, or month. Customers can also see trends and Alexa will also provide recommendations on actions that your customers can take to save energy on their compatible devices. And with Hunches, Alexa can proactively control your customers’ devices to help them save energy automatically, such as lowering the thermostat temperature when Alexa has a Hunch your customers are away from home. Customers can also see your device supports the energy dashboard on your Amazon detail page, differentiating your product and building confidence that it can track and automate their energy usage.

You can integrate the energy dashboard in two ways: If your device can track energy it uses or if you can estimate energy used by your devices, you can proactively send Alexa the energy usage information using the new Alexa.DeviceUsage.Meter API. Alternatively, you can use the new Alexa.DeviceUsage.Estimation API to let Alexa estimate the energy used by your devices on your behalf by providing power metadata such as On-Wattage and Off-Wattage. Alexa will combine this power metadata with the state and change reports data that you already share to determine how long the device has been on and estimate the energy usage accordingly. For smart thermostats, you can soon use the new Alexa.ThermostatController. HVAC.Components API to send Alexa change reports that include On/Off states and time stamps for each of the heating and cooling elements that your thermostats control. Alexa uses this component level data along with customer inputs, such as approximate square footage of their home, to estimate the energy consumed by the Heating and Cooling system controlled by the thermostat.

Philips, TP-Link, Sengled, Wemo, Emerson, Resideo’s Honeywell Home Solutions, Rheem, Aquanta, Hisense, and Fire TV Edition TVs are already integrating the energy dashboard APIs for their customers. You can learn more about Alexa’s energy dashboard in this blog and sign up here to be notified when more information is available.
Today, millions of devices use Alexa’s inventory sensor to enable convenient reordering, letting customers use Alexa to manage their supplies and place orders when they are running low. Last November, we launched the Alexa.InventoryLevelSensor capability in the Smart Home Skill API, letting you report the inventory level of consumables used by your devices, such as batteries and printer ink, and take advantage of built-in integration with Alexa to enable convenient reordering. Today, we are excited to announce you can begin integrating the new Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor capability, expanding convenient reordering to more device types such as coffee machines (coffee pods/beans), dishwashers, washing machines (detergent), and more. You simply report the usage updates from your smart home skill. Amazon provides the customer set up experience in the Alexa app, keeps track of the inventory in the cloud, and lets customers know when they are running low. Alexa will send your customers a notification when it is time to reorder – or they can set up smart reordering to allow Alexa to automatically reorder the supplies before they run out. Integrating with inventory sensors also creates new monetization opportunities for your business. You can choose to sell your own genuine consumable products that you design and manufacture specifically for your device, or you can earn recurring revenue for other compatible products sold on Amazon.

GE Appliances, LG, Samsung, and Home Connect are already integrating with the Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor to enable convenient reordering on their washing machines, dishwashers, and more. You can learn more about inventory usage sensors in this blog and sign up here to be notified when the feature is generally available.
Customers love using Alexa features that give them greater security and peace of mind when they are home or far away. With Guard Plus, announced today, Alexa can alert you about activity and other potential emergencies in your home when you're away, deter intruders with sirens, dog bark sounds, automate light control, and provide access to hands-free emergency calling. Ring, Abode, Scout Alarm, Resideo, A3 Smart Home, and Wyze will support Guard Plus and we invite you to sign up here if you are interested to participate and learn more.

We’re also excited to announce extended camera capabilities that help your customers better manage and view their smart security cameras with Alexa. Starting next month, you can enable your customers to view their camera streams through the Alexa app using your existing smart home skill integrations, and further take advantage of a new integration to enable customers to digitally or physically pan, tilt, and zoom (PTZ) their cameras from the app. Using the new Live View feature, customers can view and manage live streams from all their compatible cameras, doorbells, and Echo devices in a single place on the Alexa app. The feature also enables customers to talk to their cameras from the Alexa app, for cameras that support 2-way communication. If your cameras have the physical PTZ abilities, you can soon integrate with the Alexa.RangeController interface to enable customers to remotely control their cameras from the Alexa app, to cover a larger field of view. With these features, your customers can view and manage the live feeds of all their cameras from a single app, giving them the ability to remotely monitor their homes from anywhere where they can access the Alexa app. Live View and digital PTZ in the Alexa App will be available for all cameras and doorbells that use WebRTC streaming, enabled through integration with Alexa.RTCSessionController Interface. 

Ring, Arlo, Wyze, Logitech, August, Abode, Tuya, and Ecobee cameras and doorbells are already enabling Live View for their customers. You can learn more about App Live View and PTZ capabilities and requirements in this blog, and sign up here to be notified when more information is available.
You can connect your smart devices to Alexa using a wide variety of the most popular open standards and protocols, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth and more. These options give you the flexibility to deliver the right experience for your customers on Alexa. We are excited to announce support for lighting products using the Bluetooth Mesh protocol beginning, coming soon. With Bluetooth Mesh support, you can enable your customers to connect their Bluetooth Mesh light bulbs to compatible Echo devices and control them using Alexa. Plus, you can also integrate Bluetooth simple setup for your Bluetooth mesh devices, making setup simple for customers.

Ledvance and Sengled are already implementing Bluetooth Mesh support in their light bulbs. You can sign up here to be notified when more information is available.
We are excited to announce the local smart home skills (beta), a new capability that makes Alexa-connected devices like lights and plugs faster, more reliable, and enables offline control for customers. Alexa can translate smart home directives to your local APIs messaging specification using a JavaScript-based skill that is hosted on a customer’s Echo Family Device. With local smart home skills, your customers can control their smart lights, plugs, and switches using a local path within their home's WiFi network and get the benefits of:


Reduced latency. With a local connection, your customers will experience lower latency.
Improved reliability. Your customers’ requests will also have multiple potential routes to reach their smart device, increasing reliability. Alexa will choose the fastest, most reliable route, with a fall back to retry the next available route.
Offline control for your devices. If your customers’ internet connectivity is down, they can still use Alexa to control their smart devices for supported actions.

These benefits can translate to lower costs over time. As high-volume actions like Turn On/Off are routed to your local skill, traffic to your cloud skill can decrease, reducing your cloud traffic and operational costs.

Philips and Wemo now offer local Wi-Fi support, and LIFX, TP-Link, and Yeelight are integrating this feature in the coming months. You can sign up here to be notified when more information is available.
We continue to make it easier and more cost effective to connect devices to Alexa. You can use Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) to connect virtually any device with power to Alexa for as low as about $4 per device; you purchase the Amazon-managed ACK hardware module from one of our partner chipset suppliers and then a pay separate low, upfront fee that covers your ongoing use of the ACK cloud service for the device. As a result, you don’t need to worry about unpredictable cloud infrastructure and usage costs. ACK makes it easier to build Alexa-connected products without needing to worry about managing cloud services, Alexa skills, or complex networking and security firmware. When you add the Amazon-managed ACK module to your device, your customers get Alexa control by voice and by touch in the Alexa app, Wi-Fi simple setup, Wi-Fi Simple Reconnect, and automatic reordering of consumables your product needs to keep running at its best. The ACK module stays up to date automatically with silent, over-the-air firmware updates, and ACK’s managed cloud service meets the cloud reliability requirements of both Works with Alexa and Certified for Humans certification.

We’re excited to see leading brands like Eaton, Hamilton Beach, Mr. Christmas, Procter & Gamble, Crock-Pot, Sharp, Toshiba, Vornado and dozens of other device makers use ACK to build products ranging from air purifiers to smart switches and smart Christmas trees. You can learn more here about how ACK makes it easier, faster, and more economical to make your product an Alexa-connected smart device.
The Smart Home Skill API provides APIs you can use to build and connect virtually any device to Alexa, and we’ve added native support for even more device types like air purifiers, Bluetooth speakers, game consoles, water heaters, Christmas trees, trackers (available later this year), and many more. As you build and update your device experiences, we’ve created new tools and metrics in the smart home skill Developer Console to better help you debug, troubleshoot, and manage the performance of your smart home skills. Now, you can use the JSON schema files available on Github to validate messages before sending them to Alexa. You can use the State Reporting Test Tool to confirm the current values of all properties of Smart Home devices that are associated with your skill and your developer account. With the Smart Home Debugger tool, you can view ChangeReport, AddOrUpdateReport, and DeleteReport events that Alexa receives from your skill along with any processing errors. You can also use the Smart Home Test tool to reduce the time and cost to certify your device with the Works with Alexa program by automatically testing your smart home skill’s functionality. Lastly, coming soon you can download message IDs and associated metadata such as latency, errors, and exceptions for skill failures in the Analytic page of the Developer Console to more easily troubleshoot and solve issues that impact your customers.

You can read this blog to learn more about the new tools for the Smart Home Skill API.
Earlier this week, we shared new updates on Amazon Sidewalk, a neighborhood network designed to help customers’ devices work better both at home and beyond the front door. We’ve begun working with leading IoT silicon companies including Nordic Semiconductor, Semtech, Silicon Labs and Texas Instruments to create chipsets you can use to power new devices and enable new customer experiences. When your device is connected to the Sidewalk network, you can connect to Alexa and offer more experiences for customers like keeping track of the things they care about most, whether it’s their puppy, their keys, or their bicycle. Later this year, Tile devices will be supported on the Sidewalk network, enabling customers to keep track of their things by asking Alexa questions like “Alexa, where are my keys?”. As we continue to build this exciting new network for communities with privacy and security at the foundation, we remain committed to giving developers and device manufacturers the tools they need to help their devices connect to Sidewalk and to expand the capabilities of their devices for customers.

We encourage you to sign up to be notified when more information is available. To learn more, visit amazon.com/sidewalk.
We continue to support and invest in broadly adopted standards that give customers more choice and free developer resources for innovation. We are collaborating with companies across the industry, including Apple, Google, Comcast, and Samsung SmartThings to increase the compatibility among smart home products from smart bulbs to smart TVs through the Connected Home over IP (CHIP) working group, within the Zigbee Alliance. While CHIP has not yet published a new standard, the group has a goal to release a draft of the specs later this year. We invite everyone in the industry to get involved by joining the working group, and in the meantime, continue to develop smart home products for customers with existing technologies and tools.
Last fall, we announced the added support of Wi-Fi and Zigbee simple setup as part of the Frustration-Free Setup (FFS) initiative, aimed at making setting up a smart home absolutely simple. Starting today, we’re expanding FFS support further. Bluetooth simple setup is now generally available to start integration and will be available for customers with the launch of new Echo devices next month. This new protocol uses Bluetooth Mesh as a standards-based protocol to simplify onboarding for customers, making setup of Bluetooth-enabled devices as easy as plugging them in. With Bluetooth simple setup, there are no SDKs to integrate. Start integrating by reviewing our documentation in the FFS console, and with our new manufacturing tools, you can have your device shipping to customers in just a few weeks.
Losing connection can be a painful experience for customers. For example, if a customer has a houseful of devices registered to an old router, switching to a new router’s SSID requires them to manually visit each connected device and enter a new password. In some cases, customers have to factory reset devices to update credentials for each device. This hassle can lead customers to put off reconnecting and using their devices. Today, we’re announcing a developer preview for Wi-Fi simple reconnect, a new feature under the Frustration-Free Setup initiative. Wi-Fi simple reconnect can simplify reconnecting your device to your customer’s router if it disconnects. With Wi-Fi simple reconnect, if your device detects a wrong network password or lost access point from your Wi-Fi chipset, it now sends out a distress beacon. If a customer updates their network credentials on a nearby Amazon device, that device can detect your distress beacon and securely share its new network credentials in the background. Wi-Fi simple reconnect will be available on Echo and Fire TV devices later next month and be generally available for you to integrate next year. We’re excited to help your devices get and stay connected so customers can experience less frustration.

You can learn more about Wi-Fi simple reconnect in this blog and request access to the preview here.
Device makers now have more options to speed up their development of smart home features like Wi-Fi simple setup. You can now leverage white-label off-the-shelf products from solution providers like eWeLink and Tuya that provide built-in support for features like simple setup, decreasing your time-to-market. These solution providers handle manufacturing, certification, badging, and adding your product to the Amazon marketplace. With a qualified solution provider, you can reduce your time-to-market from months to just weeks. If you are building your own simple setup device, we now offer new references and tools to simplify manufacturing, saving up to a month of integration effort.

Help Your Customers Track, Manage, and Save on Energy Usage with Alexa’s New Energy Dashboard (Coming Soon);Thu Sep 24 11:38:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"As the number of devices in homes continues to increase, customers want to find ways to make their homes more efficient and sustainable. Amazon has committed to achieving net zero carbon by 2040 as part of The Climate Pledge, and we are innovating new ways with Alexa to make smart homes more efficient and help everyone have a positive impact on the planet. We are excited to announce the energy dashboard in the Alexa app, coming soon to all US Alexa customers. The energy dashboard helps your customers save energy and gives them a single place to track and manage energy consumed by their compatible Alexa-connected smart home devices, such as lights, plugs, switches, thermostats, TVs, and water heaters. You can soon implement new APIs to proactively report your device’s energy consumption to Alexa, or let Alexa estimate the energy used by your devices. By integrating Alexa’s energy dashboard, you can make your existing and new devices smarter and more appealing to an increasing number of customers who are looking to make their homes more sustainable. Customers can see if your device supports the energy dashboard on your Amazon.com detail page, differentiating your product and building confidence that they can track and save on energy usage. With the energy dashboard, we aim to make it easier to make a positive impact on the planet and we invite you to join us in making a difference together.
By integrating with the energy dashboard, your customers can see, in the Alexa app, how long their compatible devices have been on (hours) and the energy they consumed (kWh) by day, week, or month all in one place. Customers can see trends on device usage and Alexa will also provide recommendations on actions that your customers can take to save energy and reduce their carbon footprint. Alexa will suggest Alexa Routines that help your customer save energy – like turning off kitchen lights at midnight. Over the coming months, Alexa can also proactively act on Hunches, such as automatically turning off lights that were left on or turning down the water heater when Alexa has a hunch that the customer is away from home, helping your customers save energy without even thinking about it.
In the coming months, you can integrate your devices with the energy dashboard in two ways. You can either report the energy consumed by your devices directly to Alexa, or you can enable Alexa to estimate the energy consumed by your devices by providing the required power metadata (e.g. wattage for lights) for your device. Based on your device type and energy reporting capabilities, you can implement one of the new APIs below.

Report Your Device's Energy Consumption to Alexa
Device makers can proactively report the energy consumed by your devices to Alexa using the new Alexa.DeviceUsage.Meter.API. Alexa will then show the cumulative energy usage data to your customers by day, week, or a month on the energy dashboard. This new API allows you to specify the unit of measure (e.g. WATT_HOUR, BTU), the frequency of reporting energy consumption data (up to once a day), and specify if the energy reported is an estimate or an actual reading tracked by the device. TP-Link, Aquanta, Rheem, and Awair will be among the first to report energy consumption data for smart lights, smart plugs, and water heaters to integrate with energy dashboard in the coming months.

“We are excited to be a launch partner for the energy dashboard and Alexa Hunches, and to bring smart water heaters to Alexa. Aquanta enables customers to heat water when they need it, and save money when they don’t. Soon, when Alexa has a hunch that no one is home, she will automatically turn off an Aquanta-enabled water heater to reduce energy usage and save money.” says Matt Carlson, CEO of Aquanta.

Let Alexa Estimate Your Device’s Energy Consumption for You
For devices such as smart lights and TVs, you can let Alexa estimate your device’s energy consumption and show customers estimated energy consumption in the dashboard. To enable Alexa energy estimates for your devices you can soon use the Alexa.DeviceUsage.Estimation API to report the required power rating metadata such as On & Off wattage to Alexa as part of your device’s discovery response. Alexa will use your state and change reports to determine how long a device has been on and combine this with the power metadata you provide to estimate your device’s energy consumption in the Alexa app. For example, combining On wattage for smart lights with the PowerController, BrightnessController, and ColorTemperature change reports, Alexa will determine the amount of time the light was on and estimate the energy it consumed. Additionally, for smart lights, switches and plugs used to control lights, and TVs that already report state changes for PowerController proactively via ChangeReports, your customers can input the required power metadata directly in the Alexa app and start tracking the estimated energy consumption data. This is particularly useful for switches and plugs that don’t have energy monitoring capabilities and also don’t know the power rating (e.g. wattage) of the device they control. Phillips, Hisense, LIFX, Sengled, and Alea Labs will be using energy estimation for their devices that don't currently support energy tracking.

Enable Energy Estimates for Thermostats With the New HVAC.Components API
For smart thermostats, you can soon use the new Alexa.ThermostatController. HVAC.Components API to send Alexa change reports that include On/Off states and time stamps for each of the heating and cooling elements that your thermostats control. Alexa uses this component level data along with customer inputs, such as approximate square footage of their home, to estimate the energy consumed by the Heating and Cooling system controlled by the thermostat. Resideo’s Honeywell Home Solutions and Emerson will be adopting this new API to integrate with the energy dashboard.

Coming Soon: Enable Alexa to Proactively Act  on Hunches Without Customers Needing to Ask;Thu Sep 24 11:37:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"Alexa has already helped millions of customers with features like Hunches so they never forget to lock their front door at night or turn off their basement light. We’re inventing new experiences to make the Alexa-enabled smart home even more natural and proactive, one that is contextual enough to act on customers’ behalf. In the coming months, manufacturers of smart lights, thermostats, water heaters, and robotic vacuums can enable Alexa to proactively act on hunches without customers needing to ask. Currently, if Alexa has a hunch about your customers’ smart devices, Alexa will inform them so they can take action. For example, if Alexa has a hunch that a customer forgot to turn off the kitchen lights before going to bed, the customer would be reminded. Customers can soon choose to have Alexa proactively control their compatible devices, such as automatically turning off their lights, starting their robotic vacuum, setting their water heater to an energy saving mode, or adjusting their thermostat temperature when Alexa has a hunch they are away from the home or asleep. That means customers have fewer things to think about when at home or away so they can spend their time on more meaningful things. For device makers, your products become even smarter with Alexa and more valuable for your customers with little to no added effort. If you are a smart light, plug, switch, or robotic vacuum manufacturer, Alexa will automatically support Hunches for your devices using your existing Smart Home Skill API integration. If you make thermostats, you can soon use the new Alexa.AutomationManagement API to enable proactive automation via Hunches. You can sign up here to be notified when these features are available.
Smart light manufacturers such as Philips Hue, TP-Link, LIFX, Sengled, Wemo, IKEA and more and robotic vacuum manufacturers like iRobot and Eufy use the Alexa PowerController API to enable customers to control their lights and robotic vacuums with voice and routines. With Hunches, Alexa will use these same PowerController directives to help customers save energy by automatically turning off the lights that are accidentally left on, or start cleaning the house when Alexa has a hunch that no one is home.

Alexa can generate hunches by learning from customers’ usage patterns, such as when they speak to Alexa and when they interact with your smart home devices, enabled by your device’s state and change reporting that you already share with Alexa. When you report your device’s state and changes to Alexa, you also make Alexa and Hunches smarter by keeping Alexa informed when your device is turned on and off, delivering better experiences for customers. Higher quality reports enable better Hunches and customer experiences.
You can soon enable Alexa to proactively turn on your water heater’s energy saving mode when Alexa has a hunch that customers are away. Manufactures of water heaters and water heater controllers such as Rheem and Aquanta already use Alexa’s ToggleController to enable customers to turn on their water heater energy saving mode using their voice. Manufactures may use different names for their water heaters’ energy saver modes, such as “eco”, “energy saver”, “away mode”, and more. Coming soon, you can enable Hunches for your specific energy saver mode using new semantic extensions by updating the Alexa Discovery response for your existing ToggleController and ModeController capabilities. You specify a semantics state mapping of Alexa.States.EnergySaver to indicate the Toggle/Mode Controller instance that represents your energy saving mode. For example, if you use the ToggleController capability, Alexa uses the state mapping to send you a TurnOn directive corresponding to your specific energy saving mode when Alexa has a hunch that no one is home. Similarly, Alexa will disable the energy saving mode by sending a TurnOff directive when Alexa has a Hunch that your customer’s home is occupied.

“We are excited to partner with Alexa to bring smart water heater control to the Alexa ecosystem. Aquanta enables customers to heat water when they need it, and save money when they don’t. Soon, when Alexa has a hunch that no one is home, she will automatically turn off an Aquanta-enabled water heater to reduce energy usage and save money.” said Matt Carlson, CEO of Aquanta.
Thermostat manufacturers like Resideo’s Honeywell Home solutions already use the Alexa.ThermostatController.SetTargetTemperature directive to enable customers to control their smart thermostat with their voice. With Hunches, Alexa can soon help your customers save energy by using these same SetTargetTemperature directives to proactively set the thermostat to your customer’s preferred away or sleep temperatures when Alexa has a Hunch they are away or asleep.
If your device already supports existing automation capabilities, such as a smart thermostat, you can soon integrate the new Alexa.AutomationManagement API to coordinate when Alexa Hunches or your device controls automation. When you implement the AutomationManagement interface, Alexa notifies you when the customer opts in to use Hunches to automate their device via the Alexa app, and you notify Alexa via a ChangeReport when the customer wants to use your existing automation to control their device, such as setting a temperature schedule in your companion app. This minimizes scheduling conflicts and provides a consistent experience, helping your customers know if you or Alexa are controlling their device actions and how their feature choices change their device’s behavior. The AutomationManagement API will first support thermostats, with more devices coming soon.

To help customers know whether your device or Alexa Hunches control automation, you will need to update your product experience. This will ensure customers are always aware of how their device is operating. For example, Resideo’s Honeywell Home solutions is integrating the AutomationManagement API to coordinate when to turn off their thermostats’ schedule and geofence features in their companion app and to indicate that the thermostat is using Alexa Hunches. They also inform customers who are trying to create custom automations in their companion app, such as a temperature schedules, that doing so will disable Hunches. If a customer chooses to enable Resideo’s thermostat schedule, Alexa Hunches will be disabled to ensure the customer’s feature choice is selected.

Introducing Live View and Pan, Tilt, Zoom Capabilities for Cameras in the Alexa App;Thu Sep 24 11:34:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"Customers love using Alexa features that give them greater security and peace of mind when they are home or away. Today, we are excited to announce Live View and pan, tilt, zoom (PTZ) capabilities in the Alexa app, available later next month. With these features, your customers can view and manage the live feeds of all their compatible smart home cameras, doorbells, and echo devices, start a 2-way talk using their compatible devices, use simple touch controls to digitally pan, tilt, and zoom on their camera live feeds, or physically control their compatible cameras remotely to increase their field of view, all in the Alexa app. This gives your customers the added safety and security of monitoring their homes from anywhere where they can access the Alexa app.

You can integrate with the Alexa.RTCSessionController Interface to enable App Live View, 2-way talk and digital pan, tilt, zoom (PTZ) features when they are available next month. If your cameras supports physical PTZ capabilities, you can also integrate with the Alexa.RangeController Interface to enable customers to physically pan, tilt, and zoom their cameras from the Alexa App. These features will be available on Android and iOS platforms with touch controls at launch in the US, UK, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Japan, India, Australia, Mexico, Canada, and Brazil. Voice support for these features will be available later next year.
Customers use their Echo devices with screens to view the live feeds from their Alexa-connected cameras and doorbells. Later next month, you will be able to enable your customers to see the live feeds of your devices anywhere, using their Alexa app. You will also be able to provide 2-way communication capability to your customers, including conferencing, to communicate with the person on the other side of their smart home camera or video doorbell. Customers can tap on the name of the camera or doorbell in the Alexa app to start the live feed, then tap on the microphone icon to start 2-way talk. Customers can also seamlessly move between portrait and full screen landscape orientations by rotating their phones. To protect the privacy of your customers’ data, the Alexa app will not record or store any video feeds coming from customer cameras and doorbells. The live feed will end when there is an interruption, such as a phone call that the customer accepts, phone screen gets locked, customer navigates away to the camera settings page or to another app. The default WebRTC streaming limit is 12 hours.
While remotely watching the live view from their cameras and doorbells, customers will be able to use simple and intuitive gestures on their app to pan, tilt and zoom the live view of their cameras and doorbells. They can simply pinch and zoom or double tap to zoom in to a specific area, and swipe left/right/up/down to pan or tilt. They will also be able to physically control compatible cameras that support physical PTZ capabilities, such as rotating the camera up and down or sideways to get a larger field of view. These features will provide customers better control over the security of their homes, all in a single app.
App Live View and digital PTZ in the Alexa App will be available for all cameras and doorbells that use WebRTC streaming, enabled through integration with Alexa.RTCSessionController Interface. Brands like Ring, Arlo, Wyze, August, Abode, Tuya, and Ecobee cameras and doorbells are already enabling these features for their customers in the Alexa app. If you already support WebRTC and 2-way comms through Alexa, there is no additional work required to enable these features. Digital PTZ will be automatically supported for all cameras that support live view on the app, in portrait and landscape modes, on Android and iOS. For physical pan, tilt, zoom, you will need to declare the Alexa.RangeController capability in your Discovery response and integrate with Alexa.RangeController Interface. If you have prior integration with this API, you will need to specify additional instances, up to three, for each of the physical movements that you camera supports (pan, tilt and zoom).

Wyze expressed their excitement on this new suite of features on the Alexa app, “Alexa’s new camera features ensure Wyze customers can get the most out of their cameras, wherever they are. Live view, 2-way communication and PTZ in the Alexa app is another step forward on Wyze’s goal to give customers control when and where they need it.”

Expanding Convenient Reordering to More Device Types with New Usage Sensors (Coming Soon);Thu Sep 24 11:32:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"Last year, we enabled developers to offer convenient reordering through Alexa on devices such as smart sensors and printers with the launch of the Alexa.InventoryLevelSensor capability. Millions of Alexa connected devices already use it to offer convenient reordering, letting customers know when they are running low and making it easy for them to restock. Since then, we have further simplified the experience by enabling customers to learn about their supplies through notifications on their Echo devices, and subsequently place an order right away through voice. We also expanded convenient reordering through the Level sensor in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. We continue to add features that make customers’ lives easier and your devices smarter when connected to Alexa. Today, we are excited to announce a new Alexa capability - Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor, that enables additional device types to offer convenient reordering, such as coffee machines (coffee pods/beans), dishwashers (detergents), washing machines (detergents), paper-towel dispensers, pet food dispensers, and more.
With Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor, you simply report the consumption events via Smart Home API and Alexa will do the rest. Alexa keeps track of the inventory in the cloud and based on customer’s settings, Alexa will notify customers when supplies are running low or automatically reorder them.  For example, coffee machine developers just need to let Alexa know how many coffee-pods their device has consumed to enable convenient reordering. As a Developer, you can also earn recurring revenue from each device when customers reorder supplies, through both low-supply notifications and when smart reorders are placed.
GE Appliances, LG, Samsung, Home Connect, and more developers are already integrating with Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor to enable convenient reordering on their portfolio of devices. Developers in the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan will be able to use the Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor capability.
Devices come in all shapes and sizes, so we have designed different types of inventory sensors to best support your device experience. You can use the new Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor to enable convenient reordering for devices that measure or estimate the amount of supplies that were consumed. For example, a dishwasher can report that a detergent pod was used when the dishwasher is run, a coffee machine can report the amount of coffee beans used when coffee is brewed, etc. Alternatively, devices that store the consumable internally and can measure the remaining amount in the installed inventory can use InventoryLevelSensor capability. For example, a printer that can measure the installed ink level or a motion sensor that can measure its battery level.
When you integrate with Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor, Alexa will help customers manage their household supplies. Alexa keeps track of customers’ inventory based on the consumption information you provide using the Inventory Sensor and customer orders placed on Amazon. Alexa can let customers know when they are running low on supplies through both email and voice notifications on their Echo devices. Customers can easily place an order directly from the low-supply notification, as shown below. Customers can also sign up for smart reordering in the Alexa app.
“Our goal is to support our Home Connect consumers in their daily life and offer a wide range of possibilities and services. We’re excited to do this by offering our consumers the flexibility to manage supplies for their connected dishwashers. With Alexa they can now also be reminded and get a notification on an Echo device, for example, when dishwasher tabs become low – to never run out of stock” said Daniel Johannisborg, Head of Partner Management at Home Connect.
When you integrate the InventoryUsageSensor, your customers will receive notifications from Alexa when your device records low supplies:
You can easily enable convenient reordering on your devices via your Smart Home Skill API integration. Moreover, most of the work carries over to other regions, making it easy to for you to offer convenient reordering to customers across the world. “As the first-to-market partner to Amazon Dash Replenishment in 2016, Brother remains committed as an innovation leader in Technology in the Smart Home/office space. We’re pleased that Amazon continues to push technology boundaries to make it easy for us as a manufacturer to offer convenient reordering through Alexa, making it easier for Brother printer customers to automatically receive high-quality Brother Ink and Toner before they run out”, said Phil Lubell, Vice President of Marketing, Brother International Inc.
To integrate the new Usage sensor, you just need to define it in the Alexa.Discovery interface and report consumption events using the InventoryConsumed event. Amazon provides the customer set-up experience in the Alexa app, keeps track of the inventory in the cloud, and helps customers reorder supplies as needed. Amazon will also work with you to select the consumable products that are compatible with your devices and can be reordered when supplies run low. “Enabling convenient reordering with our SmartHQ connected appliances on our existing Alexa Smart Home Skill accelerated our development time,” said Jared Hatfield, Principal Cloud Architect on the GE Appliances SmartHQ Cloud team. “What would normally take us weeks to implement we were able to do in a matter of days. Convenient reordering is a natural extension of what Alexa already provides with our products and will allow us to continue to enhance our integrations with our smart appliances.”
Enabling convenient reordering in your Smart Home Skill with the Usage or Level sensors creates an opportunity for you, as the developer, to monetize your connected devices by creating a recurring revenue stream. You can choose to sell consumables that you manufacture specifically for your devices, such as your coffee pods for your coffee machines. Alternatively, you can sell any third party consumable product that is compatible with your device and earn a referral fee. This creates new opportunities for you to monetize your devices and grow your business. For example, a washing machine that offers third-party detergent pods could enable you as a developer to earn a one-time referral fee when customers place their first smart reorder. You will also earn revenue for all subsequent smart reorders and manual orders placed through notifications.
You can start integrating and testing the Usage sensor today by creating a device with reordering capabilities in the Dash Replenishment developer console.  You can also sign up here to be notified when the feature is generally available for customers later this year.

From 15 Taps to Near Zero: With Frustration-Free Setup, Setting Up TP-Link’s Smart Home Plugs is as Simple as Plugging Them In;Wed Sep 23 15:00:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"On the leading edge of the smart home device industry is TP-Link Research America. Known for its Kasa line of products, it produces smart plugs like the Kasa Smart Plug Mini Smart Home WiFi outlet to control standard home appliances, as well as an array of other devices like smart security cameras, light bulbs and light switches. 


TP-Link’s products have been a hit with its customers since 2015, but the company wasn’t content to stay with the status quo. Instead, it challenged itself by asking: How do you differentiate and improve on a product that customers already love? 


The answer came with Amazon’s Frustration-Free Setup (FFS). Frustration-Free Setup uses millions of existing devices in customers homes to assist devices, like TP-Link’s connecting to a customer’s network. FFS also assists with connecting TP-Link’s device to a customers Alexa account. Both steps, network and account linking typically take around 30 seconds. For FFS to work, customer’s must purchase their device from Amazon.com, agree to simplify setup from the detail page, have a provisioner in range, and Wi-Fi credentials in the Amazon Wi-Fi Locker. If this criteria is checked, once a customer unboxes and powers on their TP-Link smart plug, it will connect to the customer’s network..By integrating FFS, TP-Link made its already popular smart plug even easier to set up and operate. Now customers can simply plug the device right out of the box and get connected in as little as under a minute.


“We knew that controlling our devices through Alexa was the way to go and Frustration-Free Setup makes it even easier,” says Aakash Mangal, Cloud Developer at TP-Link Kasa.
One of the first companies to build marketable smart home products, TP-Link launched its first Kasa smart plug in 2015. The unit plugs into a regular electrical outlet and allows the user to control home appliances such as lights, fans, coffeemakers and much more. TP-Link now offers an entire line of voice-controlled Kasa smart devices, including security cameras, light switches, and light bulbs.

While Kasa smart home devices were originally controlled only via the Kasa mobile app, with the popularity of Alexa, the obvious solution was to add Alexa voice control to the smart plug. TP-Link first built a custom Alexa skill to control their devices, then eventually created an Alexa Smart Home skill. However, the company knew there was still room for improvement, especially with the initial setup.

“Our products were well-received by customers, but there was still a pain point with device setup,” says Mangal. “The user had to download the Kasa app and perform a dozen taps to make the device controllable. That’s too many.”

For example, with the Kasa app alone, it took a customer 10 to 15 taps to configure a Kasa smart plug on their phone before they could control it with Alexa. TP-Link’s goal was to offer customers a simpler, more intuitive and more out-of-the box process, reducing the number of steps to near zero.
Today, when a customer buys a Kasa smart plug, they simply take the device out of the box, plug it in, and within seconds, the device is connected and ready to be controlled using Alexa smart home voice commands.

The process appears seamless to the customer, but there’s much more happening in the background. The first time a Kasa device is plugged in, it tries to locate a provisioner—such as a nearby Echo or other Alexa-enabled device—to help it connect to the internet. The Amazon cloud then coordinates with the Kasa cloud to authenticate the device, verify user credentials, and announce the device to the network. Customers can then use Alexa to control the device connected to the smart plug. Customers can also use the Kasa mobile app, if desired, to access a number of features specific to Kasa devices.

“With FFS, the customer’s overall experience with setting up the Kasa is so much simpler that it was before,” says Mangal. “This approach provided the zero-touch setup we desired and provides a true plug-and-play experience.”
How do TP-Link’s customers feel about the simpler, zero-touch setup? Since adding Alexa voice control and now FFS to the Kasa smart plug devices, customer feedback has been positive, with an average 4.5-star product rating in the Amazon Store.

Mangal believes that FFS will attract more new customers to use smart home devices, especially those who don’t consider themselves “tech savvy”. FFS eliminates technical hurdles during setup, which is why it’s the foundation for Certified for Humans (CFH), Amazon’s program that identifies high-quality smart home experiences across setup, usability, and performance.

“We’ve worked hard to make the setup experience as simple as possible from the very beginning,” says David Li, CEO, TP-Link Kasa. “Adding Frustration-Free Setup from Amazon, we’ve been able to take our straightforward onboarding process and turn it into a truly magical experience.”

Amazon Sidewalk paves the way for more connected communities;Mon Sep 21 15:00:00 UTC 2020;Ryan Ciovacco;"How we’re making devices work better today and creating new opportunities for tomorrow
Last fall, we first announced our vision for Amazon Sidewalk, a neighborhood network designed to help customer devices work better both at home and beyond the front door. Operated by Amazon at no charge to customers, Amazon Sidewalk uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the 900 MHz spectrum and other frequencies to simplify new device setup, extend the low-bandwidth working range of devices and help devices stay online and up-to-date even if they are outside the range of home wifi. 

 As we prepare to launch Amazon Sidewalk later this year, we’re announcing several new steps towards realizing our vision for customers and developers. We’re teaming up with leading IoT silicon companies, we’re releasing details on the privacy and security protections of Sidewalk, we’re supporting additional protocols for Sidewalk and we’re embarking on a new proof-of-concept with American Red Cross to demonstrate the possibilities of Sidewalk.
After Amazon Sidewalk launches, there will be two types of devices operating on the network: Sidewalk Bridges and Sidewalk-enabled devices. Sidewalk Bridges, including select Ring Floodlight Cams and Ring Spotlight Cams, are devices that provide connections to Amazon Sidewalk. Sidewalk-enabled devices, such as smart lights at the end of your driveway, connect to Sidewalk Bridges to access the network.

Today we are announcing new additions to both categories of Sidewalk devices. First, many Echo devices will support Amazon Sidewalk beginning later this year. This means Echo customers with eligible devices, including the all-new Echo and Echo Show 10, will be able to use Echo as a Bluetooth Sidewalk Bridge to help compatible devices automatically connect or reconnect to their router, set up new Echo devices, or locate items connected to Sidewalk. We’re also excited to welcome Tile to Sidewalk later this year. Tile will offer the first third-party Sidewalk-enabled device and experience to help customers find their keys, their wallet or other things they care about using Sidewalk.

Preserving customer privacy and security is foundational to how we’ve built Amazon Sidewalk. We want to assure customers that their data is safe and in their control when sharing their bandwidth or when their devices connect to Sidewalk. And we want device manufacturers to have the assurance that the devices they create stay secure and up-to-date when connected to Sidewalk. Sidewalk protections include:

We’ve designed Amazon Sidewalk with three layers of encryption to secure data traveling on Sidewalk.
We require the same encryption standards for all third-party applications on Sidewalk as well, to prevent unauthorized access to the contents of packets.
We’ve designed Sidewalk to prevent customers with Sidewalk Bridges from viewing the data from other customers’ Sidewalk-enabled devices. Similarly, Sidewalk-enabled device owners do not have access to Sidewalk Bridge information.
We use one-way hashing keys, cryptographic algorithms and rotating device IDs to dissociate personal data from a Sidewalk-enabled device.
We set maximum upload limits and bandwidth caps to preserve internet bandwidth for Sidewalk Bridge customers.
And we provide a feature setting so that customers who own a Sidewalk Bridge can disable Amazon Sidewalk on their account at any time.

For more information on how we've designed Amazon Sidewalk to keep customer information private and secure, review our Amazon Privacy and Security Whitepaper.
With privacy and security protections at the core of Amazon Sidewalk, we’ve begun working with leading IoT silicon companies including Nordic Semiconductor, Semtech, Silicon Labs and Texas Instruments to enable chip sets that will power new devices and enable new customer benefits. We’re also announcing that Amazon Sidewalk will support multiple protocols including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) and LoRa in the 900 MHz band. Not only will this open up Sidewalk to more third-party devices, it will provide greater connectivity and help extend battery life for customer devices throughout the home and beyond.
As developers consider Sidewalk-enabled chip sets and protocols, we’re inviting them to maximize the potential of Amazon Sidewalk. These are just a few examples of the new Sidewalk experiences we’ll be working on with device manufacturers in the coming months:

Improved Range and Reliability: From door locks and water sensors to smart lights, we’ll support low-bandwidth smart devices that extend well beyond the edge of wifi networks, giving customers the assurance that their devices can stay online even if their wifi doesn’t.
Locating Valuables: Just as with Tile, we’ll welcome a range of Sidewalk-enabled devices that will locate the things customers care about most, whether it’s their puppy, their keys, or their daughter’s bicycle. 
Diagnostics: We’ll support devices like Sidewalk-enabled power tools and home appliances that will allow customer support to troubleshoot, diagnose and resolve problems even if wifi isn’t available.
Not only are we building Sidewalk to benefit customers and their neighbors, we’re building it to benefit entire communities. Later this year, we will begin a new proof of concept with the American Red Cross to explore if Amazon Sidewalk can support the tracking of blood collections supplies between distribution centers and donation sites to add new efficiencies within the blood donation supply chain. Amazon is donating the devices, technology and teams needed to support this effort. Responsible for about 40 percent of the nation’s blood supply, American Red Cross delivers a vital service to the community and we hope Sidewalk can help them make a difference.
As we continue to build this exciting new network for communities with privacy and security at the foundation, we remain committed to giving developers and device manufacturers the tools they need to help their devices connect to Sidewalk and to expand the capabilities of their devices for customers. Over the coming months we’ll be working with IoT chip set companies and device manufacturers to deliver a diverse set of devices and experiences for customers. We encourage device manufacturers to sign up to be notified when more information is available. To learn more, visit amazon.com/sidewalk.

Voice Interoperability Initiative Welcomes Facebook, Garmin and Xiaomi and Releases First Multi-Agent Design Guide ;Wed Sep 09 15:00:00 UTC 2020;Aaron Rubenson;"Last fall, Amazon and more than 30 leading technology companies announced the Voice Interoperability Initiative (VII), a new program with the mission to ensure voice-enabled products provide customers with choice and flexibility by supporting multiple voice agents simultaneously on a single device. Today, we’re excited to announce that Dolby, Facebook, Garmin, and Xiaomi have joined the initiative. We’re also releasing the first version of the Multi-Agent Design Guide, which provides recommendations and best practices for delivering delightful customer experiences on devices that support multiple voice agents.
VII is built around a shared belief that voice agents should work simultaneously alongside one another on a single device. It is built around four priorities:

Building voice-enabled devices that promote choice and flexibility through multiple, simultaneous wake words
Developing voice agents that can work seamlessly with others, while protecting the privacy and security of customers
Releasing technologies and solutions that make it easier to integrate multiple voice agents on a single product
Accelerating machine learning and conversational AI research to improve the breadth, quality and interoperability of voice services
With today’s addition of Dolby, Facebook, Garmin Xiaomi, and 38 other new members in the past year, 77 member companies now support the VII effort, including consumer electronics brands, automotive manufacturers, telecommunications operators, hardware solutions providers, and systems integrators. We welcome the newest members to the initiative and are excited about the progress we have made over the last year. We remain committed to the long-term goals of the VII and appreciate members’ support and their commitment to our shared vision.      

“Portal from Facebook devices power hands-free video calling to connect people -- and has Alexa built-in to control smart home devices, use Skills, and more. By enabling multiple voice services to co-exist on Portal, we are offering more capabilities and a better experience. We hope to see this from more companies in the future,” said Micah Collins, Director of Portal Product Management at Facebook.
“Xiaomi is a world leader in connected devices that power people’s smart living. Voice is a critical interface to offer services to our customers,” said Paul Lin, Vice President of Corporate Business Development at Xiaomi Technology. “We are excited to join the Voice Interoperability initiative to work with industry leaders to build voice-enabled products that offer customers choice and flexibility. This collaboration will enable us to bring more exciting and high quality voice and AI-enabled products to everyone around the world.”
The Multi-Agent design guide, authored by Amazon and reflecting feedback from VII members, captures design recommendations that device makers can use in building products that support multiple voice agents. The guide covers three key topic areas, specifically, customer choice and agent invocation, multi-agent experiences, and privacy and security.
Customer choice is a bedrock principle of the VII. The guide recommends letting customers choose from available voice agents by enabling the use of multiple, simultaneous wake words when more than one agent is registered on a device. Further, the multi-agent experiences section of the guide addresses fundamental behaviors that agents can employ to provide engaging interactions for customers. The guide recommends that multi-agent products help customers find the agents that are available and explore their capabilities.
Beyond discovery and education, the guide provides recommendations for agent transfer and universal device commands (UDCs). Agent transfer refers to an interoperability pattern to address a scenario in which a customer makes a request that the first agent cannot directly fulfill. The first agent can summon the other agent, without sharing data or context, to assist the customer. Agent transfer allows customers to take advantage of unique capabilities and experiences of each agent. UDCs are commands and controls that a customer may use with any agent to control certain device functions, even if the agent was not used to initiate the experience, such as changing the device volume and stopping a timer.
The guide describes some of the essential building blocks to earn and maintain customer trust, including customer privacy, agent and device security, and attention state. The guide recommends that devices with multiple, simultaneously available voice agents provide transparent, easily predictable and expected behaviors and experiences to customers. For example, the guide recommends that all coexisting agents convey at least three core attention states: listening, thinking, or speaking. The guide recommends providing visual and sound cues for the three core attention states, making it easy for customers to see and understand which agents are active and when the state changes.
To get started, you can review the video below that provides a demonstration of Multi-Agent design guide recommendations on a prototype device. You can also use the design guide as a reference while designing your own products that support multiple agents.
We will continue to update the guide based on VII member feedback. If you’re not already a member, you can sign-up here to indicate your interest.

Coming Soon: Set Up Alexa Voice Service Devices Through the Alexa App;Mon Aug 10 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Sanjay Ramaswamy;"With connected devices becoming increasingly ubiquitous around the world, customers have come to expect a struggle-free, tinker-free, and stress-free experience when setting up their devices. The complexity of setting up devices is often cited as one of the top issues in customer reviews, leading to poor product engagement and satisfaction. Amazon’s Echo Family of devices addressed this by using Frustration Free Setup (FFS) technology to provide simple and delightful setup experiences.

Today, we are excited to announce that we are bringing FFS to devices powered by Alexa Voice Service (AVS) using Amazon Common Software (ACS) for Devices (preview). Devices that integrate this technology will be able to provide customers with multiple user-friendly wifi setup paths in the Alexa app. Eligible customers that purchase these devices on Amazon.com can enjoy a delightful simplified setup experience when they power on their device. Customers that purchase elsewhere or receive the device as a gift will receive an auto-discovery notification in their Alexa app and can complete setup with just a few clicks. Customers can also perform a manual setup of the device in the Alexa app by choosing the brand and model. The setup will retrieve the customer’s credentials from their Amazon Wi-Fi Locker if saved as part of a previous Amazon device setup, so they don’t have to re-enter them.
This lets customers set up devices with just one app. Device makers no longer need to create and maintain their own app for device setup, and can instead focus their resources on core device features. With a few additional requirements, devices may become eligible for the Certified for Humans (CFH) program. Certified for Humans is an Amazon certification program for Alexa-compatible devices that identifies high-quality smart home experiences across setup, usability, and performance. Certified for Humans devices are struggle-free, tinker-free, stress-free.
When an AVS device (a provisionee seeking to be registered) powers up, it establishes a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection with a nearby Echo device or the Alexa app (a provisioner registered on the user’s account). The provisioner authenticates the device, and provides it with wifi credentials, if available. Once wifi setup is complete, the device is authorized for registration and Alexa is enabled on the device.
The integration of FFS in AVS devices is enabled through the Amazon Common Software (ACS) for Devices (currently available in preview). Amazon introduced ACS earlier this year to accelerate the integration of Amazon Device SDKs. ACS makes it easier and faster for device makers to integrate Amazon Device SDKs by providing:


A unified API integration layer,
Pre-validated and memory-efficient components for common functions such as connectivity,
A device porting kit (DPK), and
Multi-tier test suites.

Visit this page to request a preview and get early access to the technology.

You can start building with chipsets that work with ACS and FFS from Solution Providers Mediatek, NXP, Amlogic, and Espressif. You can also engage Solution Providers Tonly, Innotech, and Stream Unlimited for help with the FFS integration on your AVS device.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/08/coming-soon-set-up-alexa-voice-service-devices-through-the-alexa-app;
Introducing the New Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) Module with Espressif Chipset: Connect Nearly Any Device to Alexa with ACK;Wed Jul 22 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Ben McInnis;"Last year, we launched Alexa Connect Kit (ACK), enabling device makers to make nearly any device into an Alexa-compatible smart device without having to worry about managing cloud services, writing an Alexa skill, or developing complex networking and security firmware. Today, we are excited to announce the addition of a new ACK Module with Espressif Chipset. This new module is as much as 50% lower in cost. To learn more about the ACK Module with Espressif, sign up here and start building with Alexa Connect Kit.
With Alexa Connect Kit, you can make nearly any device with power into an Alexa-compatible smart device your customers will love, all at a fixed per-device cost. You simply integrate an Amazon-managed ACK module into your device, connect it to your device’s microcontroller (MCU) over a serial interface, and add interface code to your device’s firmware to interpret control messages from the ACK module. The ACK module adds Wi-Fi, Bluetooth LE, and all the software needed for Alexa control, Frustration Free Setup, security, and log and metric collection – managed and updated by Amazon. For your customers, products built with ACK include Alexa control through voice and the Alexa app, and the option to support Amazon Dash Replenishment. For developers, ACK enables you to connect your devices to Alexa without the need to operate a cloud, create and maintain an Alexa skill, develop a companion app, or deal with IoT firmware integration. With an ACK module on your device, you can focus on building great hardware.
ACK makes it simple, fast, and economical to create and manage Alexa-compatible smart devices. Leading device makers and consumer products brands like Eaton, Hamilton Beach, Procter & Gamble, Toshiba, Sharp, Vornado, Crock-Pot, Mr. Christmas, and more than a dozen other device makers are using Alexa Connect Kit to build products ranging from smart coffee makers to smart Christmas trees.

""Hamilton Beach is excited to be using the Alexa Connect Kit to accelerate development of our connected products and provide a great experience for our customers. We’ve seen success with our first smart coffee maker using ACK, and now that ACK costs are even lower, we are looking forward to working with Amazon to deliver more smart home products,” says Scott Tidey, Senior Vice President, North American Sales and Marketing, Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc.

“We are excited about the recent launch of our Eaton Wi-Fi Smart Devices, such as light switches, dimmers, and receptacles, that are utilizing the Alexa Connect Kit (ACK). The ACK program helped us reduce time to market, successfully launching on schedule. As we continue to develop connected solutions, we look forward to working with Amazon to deliver products and services that help power what matters for our customers,” said Mike Yelton, President of Eaton’s Commercial & Residential Distribution Solutions Business.

Turn Cost Uncertainty into Cost Certainty
IoT costs can be unpredictable with usage spikes that are difficult to plan for. With ACK, device makers pay for the ACK module and a low, upfront fee that covers the ongoing use of the ACK cloud services. As a result, device makers don’t need to worry about unpredictable costs.

Increase Your Speed to Market
ACK has allowed device makers to reduce their speed to market from years to just months. We’ve been amazed with how device makers have used Alexa Connect Kit to improve their speed to market, even when building their very first Alexa-compatible device. “Using Alexa Connect Kit, we were able to take our first Alexa-compatible product from idea to mass manufacturing in less than 6 weeks. By using Alexa Connect Kit, we could deliver a magical experience for our customers that we previously never thought possible.” said Leslie Hermanson, President, Mr. Christmas.

Create High-Quality Products with Features Customers Love
Customers love their ACK devices; every ACK device to date has a 4-star rating or higher on Amazon.com. ACK-based devices can take advantage of the capabilities of the Smart Home Skill API, as well as Frustration Free Setup, and Amazon Dash Replenishment. Plus, the ACK managed cloud service is built on AWS IoT, so ACK-built devices will automatically meet the cloud service reliability requirements necessary for Works with Alexa (WWA) and Certified for Humans (CFH) certification, subject to the testing and other requirements set forth in the program guidelines for WWA and CFH. After your device is certified, you can feature the WWA or CFH badges in the Amazon Smart Home Store and on product packaging, opening new marketing opportunities and increasing customer confidence that your devices integrate seamlessly with Alexa.
The ACK development board and prototyping tools make it easy to get started. You can prototype your product using the ACK development kit, module, and device SDK, and move to mass manufacturing when you’re ready.

5 Years of Building for Voice with the Alexa Skills Kit, Alexa Voice Service, and Alexa Fund;Fri Jul 17 07:00:00 UTC 2020;David Isbitski;"A Chief Evangelist’s Love Letter to the Community
 
June marked the five-year anniversary of the Alexa Skills Kit, Alexa Voice Service, and Alexa Fund. Over the last several days I’ve reflected on what an incredible journey these past five years have been, and like other big milestones, this gives us an opportunity to look back, and see what’s ahead. In the beginning, we only imagined what the possibilities of a voice-driven experience could be.
We’ve built something together that customers around the globe use every day. There are over 100,000 Alexa skills, more than 200 Alexa built-in products and over 700,000 developers, like you, creating solutions. Customers have purchased hundreds of millions of Alexa devices, interact with Alexa billions of times each week, with engagement nearly quadrupling over the last two years.
Since launching the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), we’ve made hundreds of new tools and APIs available, based on your feedback. To start, we provided a way for you to run your own code inside of a compute instance using AWS Lambda. We provided those discounted compute hours, so you could explore and dream what was possible without worrying about hosting costs. We provided an API to build your own intent schemas and sample utterances creating a simplified way of building conversational experiences within your newly created AWS Lambda service.
Starting in 2015, we met with you face-to-face during the Alexa Roadshow, to hear and experience what it was like to be an Alexa skill developer first-hand. By the summer of 2016, we participated in hundreds of hackathons across the globe and watched thousands of you build Alexa skills! Using only those early tools, you built over 5,000 skills in the first year, up from just 200 skills the year before. Those skills were enjoyed by millions of customers across the U.S., UK, and Germany that year with many more countries to soon follow.
Since then, we’ve launched the Smart Home Skills API and watched you build voice-driven experiences for customers across 100,000 smart home products including lights, routers, smoke detectors, coffee makers, and more. With the Alexa Voice Service (AVS), we enabled device makers to create devices with Alexa built-in, offering customers access to Alexa directly from their own devices. Thanks to you, customers can find Alexa built-in products like TVs, PCs, to mirrors, and more.  We also launched a new ASK Built-in library to give  you access to hundreds of new intents and slots. This helped solve some of the most common issues you shared with us, providing a richer experience for customers with higher levels of accuracy.
 
Based on your feedback, hundreds of new features were added, including a complete redesign of the developer console for a visual way to code and test your skills, the Metrics API to see how your skills are being used, and a Skills Simulator for testing, among others. More features continue to be released based on your feedback, allowing new ways for you to improve customer experience as we build the future of voice technology.
With the launch of new types of devices, like the Echo Show, came the need to build across both visual and audio-only experiences.
In 2018, we launched the Alexa Presentation Language (APL), giving you the ability to create visually rich Alexa skills that included graphics, images, slideshows, and video across not only Echo devices, but Fire TV as well. We also introduced the Alexa Smart Screen SDK for device makers, enabling them to create screen-based products with Alexa. These tools opened new opportunities for developers to build visually-rich voice experiences.  
 
We also wanted to give more people the ability to build for voice. In 2018 we introduced Alexa Blueprints, allowing anyone to build their own Alexa skills without any coding required.
With the foundational tools and service in place, we heard loud and clear that you needed the ability to monetize the voice experiences you were building. In 2018, we opened up the ability to perform transactions inside skills through In-Skill Purchasing , Amazon Pay and the ability to link your Alexa skills to your existing customers.
 
There are now hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built-in, from headphones and PCs to vehicles and smart home devices. In fact, more than 90% of Alexa-enabled products released last year were built by someone other than Amazon. There are also more than 100,000 smart home products that can be controlled with Alexa, from more than 9,500 unique brands.
In addition, since its launch, the Alexa Fund has invested in more than 60 companies to help fuel voice technology innovation and launched programs like Alexa Next Stage to provide additional support to early and later stage startups working to invent the next big thing in conversational AI.
 
Today, Alexa is helping to generate billions of dollars for the developer and device maker community. There are new businesses that only exist because of voice, your hard work and belief that together we are building something that fundamentally changes the way people interact with technology.
As exciting as the past five years have been, it’s still Day 1. Our goal, as always, is to continue to innovate on your behalf with the tools and services you need, and then get out of the way.
Without giving too much away, we have been working hard on new tools and features to help you make customer experiences richer, more engaging, and more delightful—whether they’re delivered through Alexa skills or devices. Next week on July 22, we will be hosting a free virtual event called Alexa Live where we will share our vision of what’s to come, including new product advances, and there will be a fun line-up of expert speakers, excited to discuss the latest in voice innovations and help you get building.

Introducing New Works with Alexa (WWA) Requirements For Zigbee Devices;Fri Jul 10 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Ben Grossman;"Beginning in December 2020, Zigbee devices must have implemented with ‘Works With All hubs’ (WWAHu) cluster in order to be certified for and receive the Works with Alexa (WWA) badge. The Works with All Hubs (WWAHu) is a custom Zigbee cluster that standardizes best practices to improve security, reliability, and interoperability for Zigbee devices with Alexa. Since 2018, Amazon has led the All Hubs Initiative within the Zigbee Alliance to make smart home and IoT products easier to develop, deploy, and sell across ecosystems. The All Hubs Initiative brought together leading Zigbee product, hardware and Hub companies to incorporate and standardize best practices into the Zigbee specification. The Alliance incorporates over 150 All Hubs requirements, and Amazon has worked with leading Zigbee stack vendors to implement a custom Works With All Hubs (WWAHu) cluster which allows many of these features to be leveraged by Zigbee devices today.
To support the new standards, starting in December 2020 Zigbee devices will be required to have implemented the WWAHu cluster in order to be eligible for the Works with Alexa badge and certification. These new requirements will help verify the responsiveness, reliability, and functionality of Alexa-connected Zigbee devices, ensuring your customers have the best smart device experiences. You can learn more about the upcoming Works with All Hubs requirements by reading the technical documentation for Smart Home Zigbee Support.
You can either choose to implement this cluster yourself, or you can ask the Zigbee Stack vendor your product uses for their WWAHu cluster implementation. Many Zigbee stack vendors including Silabs, NXP, and Ubisys have implemented the WWAHu cluster and it is available from them upon request for incorporation into Zigbee 3.0 products. Contact your stack vendor for more information and pricing.
Once the new requirements go into effect in December 2020, you can submit your smart devices for Works With Alexa (WWA) certification via the WWA Console only after you have finished adding Zigbee with the WWAHu cluster to your devices. To obtain a Works with Alexa badge for your Zigbee devices, we recommend you first verify that your device:


Meets the WWA program guidelines: Your product satisfies connectivity, service reliability, and feature standards for quality and integration with Alexa.
Has tested Zigbee integration: Your device should be thoroughly tested with an Echo Plus device, verified that Alexa can discover your device, and that you can interact with it by using the standard utterances for your device type. For a complete list of WWA test cases available in the Alexa Certification Console.
Has tested Works with All Hubs cluster: WWAHu Testing harness tools will be available for download in the WWA console to ensure you have properly implemented the cluster. You can use the tools to pre-test your device, but passing the test cases in the tool is not a guarantee that your device will pass certification. Test cases may change, and environmental conditions can play a role in certification test results. Note that Works with Alexa honors certification test results for the WWAHu cluster performed by Element Materials Technology.

Creating a Great Out-Of-The Box Experience (OOBE);Mon Jun 22 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Gavin O'Duffy;"As a device maker, you are providing your customers with a new experience by including Alexa. Interacting with your product via voice will give them a more natural experience. Your customer is going to take a journey with your Alexa Voice Service (AVS) product. From taking it out of the box, to setting it up, to discovering what it can do, to making it a part of their everyday lives - the journey should be as easy and delightful as possible. Your customer may not be familiar with Alexa. And they will certainly want to learn about what your product can do, and how Alexa can help.
The Out-Of-Box Experience (OOBE), including packaging and setup, is crucial to educate and delight your customer. Getting this right can make the customer experience a positive and exciting one. But doing it wrong can lead to your customers not utilising your product, and Alexa, to its full potential, or in the way you envisaged when you set about creating it. This blog post will share tips and guidelines on how to create the best Out-Of-Box Experience from how you should think about your packaging right through to the best possible setup experience.
Your product packaging, and the printed materials in the box, such as a user guide, provide your first physical opportunity to introduce the product and it’s Alexa capabilities. In addition to adhering to our Alexa Marketing and Branding guidelines, these materials should:

Educate customers about the benefits of using Alexa on the device
Highlight interesting or relevant Alexa capabilities and use cases
Showcase features of your product that will surprise and delight your customer
Offer example customer utterances (Things to Try)
Introduce ways for the customer to explore and learn more
Offer easy suggestions to get help if the customer is confused or needs more information.

If your device does not have easily identifiable physical buttons to interact with Alexa, your materials should also include:

How to start an Alexa interaction
How to interrupt Alexa
How to turn the wake word on and off, if your product is voice-initiated.


The packaging provides basic information on Alexa. The first interaction with Alexa will happen during the setup. In the next section, learn how to create a frictionless setup experience for your customers.
Device setup can be intimidating to many customers. It helps to have a well-designed product companion app with a clear and easy-to-follow set of instructions for setting up and configuring your product. AVS provides prebuilt, or hosted, screens for use during OOBE setup and education.
AVS setup is a combination of introduction and educational screens, meant to communicate the value of Alexa to the customer, and authentication screens which enable the customer to log in with their Amazon credentials. The screens are combined into a three-step process:

Introduction screens, or splash screens
Authentication screens, or LWA (Login with Amazon) screens
Customer Education screens, or Things to Try screens

You must also provide the customer a way to log out of their account. Logout functionality is typically included in the Alexa settings of your app. If your app does not have any settings for Alexa, you can reuse your Things to Try page for logout, while reminding your customers about the benefits of remaining logged in to Alexa.
The examples found in this blog post are formatted for standard mobile phone and tablet display proportions and orientations. They will work on a range of displays but may require additional modification in order to provide a high-quality customer experience. A successful integration must maintain access to and legibility of content.
Some Alexa setup screens are provided for you. Others can be designed to your own specifications, as long as the specific requirements discussed in this blog post are met. Example screens are provided on our developer portal.
1. Step: Introduction screens
The introduction, or splash screen presents Alexa to customers in a way that encourages them to engage using your device. In a simple way it describes who Alexa is, what kinds of things Alexa can do, and the benefits of a voice-enabled experience.
The splash screen must contain:

Amazon Alexa logo
Mention of Amazon
Description of who Alexa is
Description of what Alexa does
A link to initiate authentication flow

When creating the splash screen, please refer to Alexa Voice and Marketing guidelines.
Devices using a companion app

If you are creating an iOS or Android companion app to set up Alexa on your device, Alexa Voice Service (AVS) supplies you with a prebuilt, or hosted, splash screen for your app. You are required to use the hosted splash screen in your companion app. It allows customers to become familiar with Alexa in a consistent, way. In addition, it allows us to include future updates and improvements to the splash screen without requiring changes to your app.
The hosted splash screen includes a link to the authentication flow allowing customers to login to Alexa, as described on the website. See Authorize from a Companion App for details about using the hosted splash screen.
Devices with screens/Code-based linking
If you are creating a screen-based device or using code-based linking to set up Alexa, you will need to create your own splash screen. You should attempt to create the same experience described above, a consistent introduction to Alexa and what she can do. While a single splash screen is often sufficient, you may use a series of screens or animations. Example text for the splash screen is provided on the website, as are example screen designs.
 
2. Step: Authorization and authentication using Login with Amazon (LWA)
Login with Amazon (LWA) is required to authorize (initial account creation) and authenticate (subsequent login) customers on Alexa Built-in products. Based on your AVS implementation, choose one of the following approaches for implementing LWA:
Authenticate from a Companion App 
This approach packages the Alexa Setup screens into a mobile app experience (iOS/Android) created by the developer. Amazon provides access to Login with Amazon as web views, and the developers build the Introductory and Education screens according to Amazon's guidelines. Learn more:

Authorizing from a Companion App (Android/iOS)
Authorizing from a Companion Web Site.

Authenticate from an Alexa Built-in Device 
This approach displays the Alexa Setup screens on the device. Login with Amazon is still provided as web views that the device will need to render. This is only available for touch screen-driven experiences, and also requires a local browser in order to allow new customers to create an Amazon account. Learn more: Authorizing Your Alexa Built-in Mobile Product.
Authenticate with Code-Based Linking
 This approach is intended for products that can present a code right from their screen, and where input of customer credentials would be inconvenient. Code-based linking moves LWA from a device's companion app to the web via a secondary device such as a mobile phone, tablet, or personal computer. Learn more: Authorizing with Code-Based Linking.
Login with Amazon (LWA) screens must be implemented to Amazon specifications. See the Login with Amazon implementation guides linked above for detailed specifications. For all approaches, be sure to give your Security Profile a name that matches the name or brand of your product so that a customer is confident they are authenticating to your device.

3. Step: Customer Education screens
The Customer Education screens serve two purposes: confirm successful login and give customers suggestions for how to use Alexa, otherwise known as Things to Try.
You must always include example utterances in this section. If your application has a separate Alexa logout screen within its settings, consider including Things to Try examples so that customers know the benefits of staying signed in.
The Things to Try screen requirements:

Amazon Alexa logo
Mention of Amazon
Description of how to wake Alexa
Example utterances
A link to download or open the Amazon Alexa app.

The number of example utterances displayed can vary depending on their length and the space available. If long example utterances must wrap onto a second line, avoid having a single word on a line, and ensure the spacing between lines is less than the spacing between utterances. Consider the following when writing example utterances:

The utterances should relate to the product’s use cases. A speaker may emphasize audio controls, while a kitchen product may emphasize timers and alarms.
If the product is voice-initiated, the example utterances should start with wake word “Alexa”.
If the product is touch-initiated, the example utterances should not start with “Alexa”.
The utterances should not reference third-party products the customer must purchase in addition to your product.
The utterances should not reference third-party skills that the customer must enable manually. However, you may include examples of how to enable or use your own skills.


If the device your customer signs in from supports the Amazon Alexa app, you must:

Link directly to the Amazon Alexa app if installed, or
Link to the Amazon Alexa app in the app store for your OS.


The syntax for the links is: https://alexa.amazon.com (Android) and alexa:// (iOS).
If the device your customer signs in from does not support the Amazon Alexa app, you must inform the customer that the Amazon Alexa app is available for download. However, you are not required to link directly to the app in the app store for your OS. Example text for the ‘Things To Try’ screen is provided on our website, as are example screen designs. See the Setup and Authentication page for more information.
In addition, there are UX Logo and Brand Usage guidelines for the device and companion app screens you will create.
After Alexa is set up, your companion app will still be important as a source of information and education for the customer, as well as a place to access settings that are not available in the Alexa app. Continuing to help customers explore is important to driving ongoing engagement with your product.
Both product and Alexa settings should always be easy to find and understand. Try to give your customer as much control over their experience as you can, especially for functions that are not available in the Alexa app. These are some of the settings you can include in your product's companion app:

Signing in and out
Enabling and disabling the start and stop listening sounds (only for products with prominent visual attention systems)
Alexa language selection.

If the customer chooses not to enable Alexa initially during setup, it should be easy to locate and enable in the future.

Learn How to Combine the Smart Home API and Custom API in Your Skills with Multi-Capability Skills (MCS);Sun Jun 21 07:00:00 UTC 2020;German Viscuso;"In this guide, you will learn how to create a multi-capability skill (MCS) that supports both a Custom and a Smart Home model as part of the same skill. Combining your skill models with MCS let's your expand the functionalities and control of your smart home devices by adding support for additional custom skill interactions.
A multi-capability skill (MCS) is a skill that combines the Custom skill APIs with pre-built Smart Home API into a single skill. Previously, when creating a new skill, developers would have to build and manage two separate distinct skills in order to support a broader range of features and utterances for their devices. With MCS, developers can now maintain a single skill that supports pre-built and custom interaction models. 

You can use the Alexa Skill Management API (SMAPI), the ASK-CLI, or the Alexa Developer Console (as shown here) to create a new multi-capability skill or to upgrade your existing smart home or custom skill. Adding the new API in the skill manifest file (skill.json) and updating/deploying using SMAPI or the CLI will create an MCS. The Models section in Developer console also allows you to upgrade your skill to MCS.
When you create an an MCS skill via SMAPI or the CLI, you need to ensure you support a back-end that satisfies more than one skill model. You can use a single Lambda function to process requests coming from the different sides of a MCS, for example smart home requests such as Discovery directives and Custom requests such as Launch or Intent requests.  In order to use a single Lambda function, you'll need to provide the same Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your deployed Lambda function to both the Smart Home model settings and the Custom model settings.

In the Smart Home skill settings the ARN has to be provided here:
Additionally, you are required to configure Account Linking in your Smart Home skill settings. For more information on configuring account linking for smart home skills using MCS, see our step-by-step tutorial.

In the Custom skill settings the ARN has to provided in this section:
Note: if you are using an Alexa-hosted Skill, you can copy the ARN and use it as shown above. 

Next, you need to route the appropriate type of request in the Lambda depending on which skill model they come from. If you are working with a Node.js based Lambda, you can have a main entry point as index.js and detect if the incoming request is a Smart Home directive or a Custom skill request as part of a session. Then you can define separate sub-modules to process each type of request such as indexDirective.js and indexSession.js. 
 
The below sample code shows an example MCS skill for creating a virtual beeper device that supports the functionality of turning on and off. In this case, the main entry point of the Lambda (index.js) would be as follows:
If you already created Lambda code to process your custom skill requests (such as LaunchRequest, IntentRequest, etc) you can copy it into indexSession.js and use session attributes to pass back commands to your device:
Next, in indexDirective.js, you will host your classic Smart Home lambda code to process the API directives. In this case, we're responding to Authorization and Discovery directives and supporting the PowerController interface so the virtual beeper can be turned on/off:
In the sample code above, you may have noticed an extra interface in the Alexa.Discovery namespace: Alexa.CustomIntent. This interface enables you to use the Smart Home skill discovery process to associate custom intents with device endpoints. A customer can then use the intents with that device by including the device's invocation name when they make an Alexa request. This provides a more seamless and consistent experience customers, as a custom intent can be triggered by a non-custom invocation (e.g. one without ""open""). With this, you can extend the ways customers can talk to your devices beyond what's supported in the pre-built Smart Home APIs interaction model.

To learn more, follow the step-by-step guide with instructions on how to build a sample Multi-capability skill that controls a virtual beeper.

Mic Check: How Vesper’s Revolutionary Microphones Allow Voice Interfaces to Exist Nearly Everywhere;Fri Jun 12 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Marion Desmazieres;"Vesper is building next-generation microphones for smartphones and connected devices, revolutionizing technology that has not seen significant innovation in more than a century.
The architectural and material principles of many microphones used today have remained largely unchanged since Alexander Graham Bell patented the first device in 1876. Today’s most commonly-used technology is the condenser microphone, which traps air between a thin membrane and solid metal plate, reacting to distance between the two surfaces.
There are significant downsides to this method of audio capture: condenser microphones are highly susceptible to water, oil, dust, and particle contaminants – thus limiting the environments in which they can be used. They also require a constant power source in order to operate.
That’s where Boston-based company Vesper saw an opportunity, pioneering a new form factor for microphones that can operate in nearly any conditions where sound is possible. It’s not simply their environmental flexibility that makes Vesper’s microphones so powerful, but also their ability to generate electrical charge when bent or stressed, known as piezoelectric force.
Harvesting energy from the vibrations of the voice itself, these devices require minimal electrical input in order to operate. As a result, Vesper’s microphones – and the voice and sound devices in which they operate – can be freed from a wall socket or power input, offering vast new possibilities for smart devices and voice interfaces.
Vesper’s CEO Matt Crowley began working with piezoelectric devices in 2007, when the field was in its infancy. In 2014, he partnered with Bobby Littrell, who was developing piezoelectric microphones for possible use by NASA and DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, responsible for developing new military technologies).
“NASA was using microphone arrays outdoors to monitor airplanes,” Crowley said, “but they had to bring all the microphones indoors every night because if you left them outside, any kind of adverse weather would break them. At the same time DARPA was pushing the idea of event-driven sensors, devices that will turn off and on automatically in response to the environment, so our low-power listening devices that weren’t sensitive to the weather seemed like a perfect fit.”
Initially, Vesper intended their devices for use in highly technical environments that would require bleeding edge innovations. However, with the emergence of voice interfaces and ambient computing on a consumer scale, Vesper’s use cases immediately expanded from the rarefied world of research and development to everyday use. “It wasn’t long after we secured our seed funding that the Amazon Echo was launched,” Crowley said. “Suddenly voice just started taking off, and it completely changed the direction of our business.”
The applications and form factors that Vesper’s piezoelectric microphones could enable made them a perfect fit for voice. “You don't have to worry if the system is going to be left indoors or outdoors… or if it's going to be exposed to dirt or smoke,” Crowley explained. “And then because it’s battery powered, I can have portable voice systems. I can put a little voice pod in every room.”
But with newfound opportunities came new challenges – specifically the ability to scale manufacturing to fabricate tens of millions of low-cost units every month, rather than a few hundred, as they had initially envisioned. Beginning in 2014, the Vesper team started work with semiconductor foundries and technology fabricators to develop a fabrication process that could allow them to scale up. They also developed a unique acoustic testing process for each of the microphones they ship, in order to improve quality assurance.
The Vesper team already knew some of the engineers at Amazon, and when they learned about the launch of the Alexa Fund they asked for an introduction. Vesper was among the Alexa Fund’s earliest investments in December 2016.
Many of Vesper’s current partnerships were facilitated by the Alexa Fund’s portfolio development team, which helped advocate for Vesper by facilitating introductions with various businesses within Amazon.
“A lot of the projects that will be available to customers later this year or next were facilitated by the Alexa Fund team,” Crowley said. “For example, within Amazon, the Alexa Fund introduces us to business teams, so that when they’re generating ideas for new products, they’re aware of the capabilities we may be able to bring. Someone might say, ‘this product would be great if it was battery powered, but we can’t do it,’ someone from the Alexa Fund will say, ‘Wait a minute. There is a technology you might want to look at.’”
Among the third-party devices where Vesper’s microphones can be found today are simplehuman’s voice-operated garbage cans. Linkplay has also integrated Vesper microphones into their audio modules and integration boards.
While Crowley and his team can’t disclose precisely what they’re working on, there are entirely new product lines on the near-term horizon for Vesper. The team is also developing sophisticated signal processing techniques to separate unwanted ambient noise from a speaker’s voice, allowing for the use of microphones in adverse conditions.
As a member of the Voice Interoperability Initiative, Vesper is also working to ensure that voice-enabled devices promote customer choice, allowing the user to choose their preferred voice service through multiple, simultaneous wake words.
“The emergence of voice, and all these new voice-powered devices, has been critical to the success of our company,” Crowley said. “And there’s such a huge diversity of devices and possibilities – not only are we working with a company to make a voice-powered garbage can, but we’re also working with biotech and medical device companies, agricultural operations, and home safety devices. And there’s a lot of growth ahead.”

With the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), you can build your own Alexa skills, which are like apps for Alexa. Skills let customers use their voices to perform everyday tasks like checking the news, listening to music, playing a game, and more. The Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) is a collection of self-service APIs and tools for making Alexa skills. Get started today with our beginner resources.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2020/05/celebrating-the-2020-webby-award-winning-alexa-skills;
Introducing Multi-Capability Skills: Expand Your Device Experience by Combining Smart Home and Custom Skill Models into a Single Skill;Thu May 28 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Ahmed El Araby;"Today, we are introducing the general availability of Multi-Capability Skills (MCS), a new way to combine the Smart Home Skill and Custom Skill models into a single skill. Now, smart home device developers can publish and maintain a single skill that enables both the smart home and custom features for their devices, simplifying their skill maintenance and creating a more seamless customer experience. With MCS, you can extend the built-in Smart Home skill utterances with your own custom voice interaction model to support nearly any feature, without customers needing to enable and invoke two separate skills. For example, you can leverage the Smart Home model’s built-in support for utterances that turn a device on or off, and have your skill support custom utterances like “Alexa, ask Roomba to vacuum the kitchen”, or “Alexa, ask myskill what can this device do?”, all in the same skill. And with MCS, if you already have a live skill, you can simply update the additional smart home or custom skill model without needing to rebuild from scratch.
Multi-capability skills simplify developers’ back-end management. With MCS, you can now publish and maintain a single skill that enables both the smart home skill and custom skill features, allowing your device to more seamlessly support nearly any feature without needing to configure and maintain two separate custom and smart home skills. Until today, smart home device developers needed to choose to either create a Smart Home Skill to leverage a defined set of built-in smart home capabilities, create a Custom Skill to support additional capabilities not included in the Smart Home API, or create both skills. However, choosing a single skill model may not accommodate all features for all devices, and while a developer could build both a custom and smart home skill, it added the complexity of managing two skill experiences and requiring customers to enable multiple skills. For example, smart router owners can use the Smart Home Networking API to allow Alexa to control their internet access, such as “Alexa, turn off the internet.” However, the Alexa home networking API does not support invoking speed tests to measure the internet connection speed. The developer would need to build and maintain a separate custom skill so users could say “Alexa, test my internet speed”. Instead, with MCS developers can now support these features in a single skill.
Simplifying your development process doesn’t mean compromising customer experience. With MCS, customers no longer need to search for or enable multiple skills to access all the features of their Alexa-connected device. MCS removes the friction of customers needing to remember different skill names, allowing customers to access all the expanded smart home features with a single invocation name. For example, by building a multi-capability skill, Dyson enabled its customers to interact more naturally with their Alexa-connected devices. Customers can control their Dyson fans with commands like “Alexa, set the fan speed to 5,” or “Alexa, set Oscillation to wide,” and set night modes and quiet modes in their daily routines, all features previously not available in a single skill experience. 

Likewise, with MCS Alexa customers in the US with compatible TP-Link routers can access expanded device features in a single skill. Using pre-built Smart Home API commands, customers can control their internet access across some or all of their household’s connected devices by saying commands like “Alexa, pause internet for Timmy’s iPad.” In addition, TP-Link offers unique voice controls using its custom model, like “Alexa, ask TP-Link to enable gaming mode.” MCS allowed the combination of these device control features in a single skill without customers needing to enable separate skills.
You can create a multi-capability skill by adding an additional model to a base skill using the Alexa Developer Console, through SMAPI directly - the Alexa Skills Kit Command-Line Interface (ASK CLI) and updating your skill logic to handle requests from those models. You can also update existing skills through the Alexa Developer Console as part of the skill configuration workflow and you can create MCS on your live skill development version, letting you test expanded feature support before submitting for certification. To revert to the original skill state, you can also delete the new model as long as you haven’t submitted the skill.

To create a new MCS with both smart home and custom skill capabilities:

1. Follow the instructions in Create a skill to create your new skill:
2. Click “MODELS”:
3. In this example we will add a smart home model to the skill. Note, that in order to add a smart home model to an existing custom skill your new skill must meet the prerequisites of smart home skill development:
4. Confirm your changes and save:
5. That’s it, your skill is now a Multi-Capability Skill with two models in the selected locale (EN_US). Note that you have to add both models for each locale.
After adding a model to your skill, you will need to properly handle the functionality of the model in your skill logic in the same way you would previously handle custom or smart home requests in separate skills. For example, if you have an existing skill that uses a smart home model and you would like to update it to use a custom model, you would also need to add skill logic to handle the session requests from the custom interaction model either manually or with one of the Alexa Skill Kit Software Development Kits (SDKs) for Node.js, Java, or Python. This means evaluating the incoming request and responding appropriately to incoming custom session or smart home directive requests.
You can support state and change reporting for device endpoints when you upgrade a custom skill to MCS. Your skill needs to follow the guidelines of sending events to Alexa gateway and how to authenticate a customer to Alexa with permissions. To allow existing customers to benefit from the state and change reporting experience, Alexa will run an automated silent process within a week from the upgrade date to send your skill an AcceptGrant directive for each existing customer. You will receive an email with the results.
If you plan to support more than one language or locale, your MCS must have an instance of each skill model type for each language. For example, if you intend to support English in both Canada and the US, you will need a custom model and a smart home model for each language. The custom model should at least handle the basic Amazon built-in intents.
When you upgrade an existing smart home skill to MCS by adding a custom model, you should educate your users about the new custom capabilities and how to use them. Let users know how they can interact with the custom model capabilities by adding your device’s newly supported utterances on your skill description page, product website, and other mediums to drive awareness of your enhanced voice experience.
You can read more about Multi-Capability Skills in the documentation here, with details on how to upgrade existing skills using the developer console or with the ASK CLI, and additional FAQs.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/05/Introducing-Multi-Capability-Skills;
Authorized Test Labs (ATL) now Generally Available for Alexa Built-in Devices;Fri May 08 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Abdul Khan;"Today we are excited to announce the general availability of Authorized Test Labs (ATL) for Alexa Built-in devices, allowing device makers and solution providers to work directly with Authorized Test Labs for Alexa Built-in certification and testing.

The Alexa Built-in testing and certification process helps device makers building commercial products with Alexa Voice Service deliver a delightful voice experience for customers. Previously, all certification testing was performed through our facilities in the United States. Now, with several ATLs to choose from, device makers can work directly with an ATL to simplify and expedite the testing and certification process.
We worked with leading testing labs to ensure every ATL meets the requirements for the Alexa Built-in testing and certification process and is compliant with ISO 17025 for testing and calibration laboratories.

As Brett J. Day, Lab Supervisor SE GLOBAL SVCSL, Spirent explains: ""As an Authorized Test Lab (ATL) for Alexa Built-in devices, Spirent can now help developers streamline the path to certification and reduce time to market while assuring their product delivers the high quality and consistent experience that Alexa customers expect. Testing is conducted at the Spirent performance center, our state-of-the-art lab facility that provides a range of audio quality and acoustic test services.

We piloted Authorized Test Labs with Alexa Built-in device makers last year, and heard from customers that ATLs simplify testing, reduce certification timelines, and accelerate time to market: 

Evan Liu, Audio Design Engineer, LC Future Center states “We have been using PAL Acoustic’s services to certify our Alexa for PC projects. We found it much more efficient and effective to work through an ATL in our local region. Working with a local ATL not only reduces the cycle times we had shipping samples to California, but also lets our engineers and supply chain partners quickly investigate bugs and provide fixes. We can now immediately make changes based on PAL’s feedback. This lets us complete certification in as little as five days which accelerates our time to market.“
To get started, select an ATL at Authorized Third-Party Labs, and navigate to their website to get more details on process and pricing. After an ATL works with you to confirm your device meets certification requirements, the ATL will submit your certification test report to Amazon for final approval.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/05/authorized-test-labs-now-generally-available-for-alexa-built-in-devices;
Create a Sample Alexa Built-in Disco Ball with Smart Home for AVS;Fri Apr 17 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Eric Fahsl;"In December, Amazon released Smart Home for AVS—an update to the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) API that enables voice control of smart home functionality on Alexa Built-in products. With this release, device makers can now send smart home commands via AVS events and directives without needing to build a separate Smart Home skill, AWS Lambda function, or device cloud to communicate to the device. Today, we will walk you through the steps to enable a sample disco ball device and receive the new directives in the AVS Device SDK Sample App starting in v1.17. You can also watch a video version of the guide below.
Smart Home for AVS provides a great simplification and optimization for Alexa Built-in device makers and provides new functionalities for device makers who do not have the ability to manage a third-party cloud. Additionally, this approach reduces development time, operational costs, simplifies debugging, and reduces latency. Today, we will review the details of what is available.
There are now four Smart Home interfaces available through AVS:

Alexa.PowerController – for use of turning devices or settings on or off.
Alexa.ToggleController – similar to power, a binary toggle that allows the customer to choose the name of the property
Alexa.RangeController – allows the customer to set a value of a customizable range, including increasing or decreasing, even defining values for “low,” “medium,” “high,” “min,” “max,” and more.
Alexa.ModeController – sets different customizable modes on the device. Combined with richer Smart Home features such as primitives and semantic annotations, this offers greater flexibility for device control.

Device makers can start taking advantage of this today by updating their client to use the Alexa.Discovery API instead of the Capabilities API. For developers using the AVS Device SDK, v1.17 adds new Capability Agents for each of the four supported Smart Home interfaces and the Sample App has been updated to create a new virtual device called Discoball.
Before we get started, note you will need to have the AVS Device SDK Sample App running on a device, whether it be your local developer machine or a Raspberry Pi. See our Getting Started section of the AVS Device SDK GitHub page if you have not yet completed this. 
First, in order to understand the functionality, let’s take a look at what has changed. In the SampleApp/src/SampleApplication.cpp, you’ll notice the following lines:
This is where the application declares the “friendly name,” or the name of the device that your users will call it in their utterances to Alexa. You can rename this to something else if you like.
In the code below, we will enable all four capabilities, but let’s first inspect the PowerController as it is simpler and easy to follow. Further down in SampleApplication.cpp, we can see the code for defining and creating the PowerControllerHandler:
This is where our Sample App declares we are using the PowerController and will use the PowerController capability agent to add to our Discovery call.
Next, let’s look at the SampleApp/src/PowerControllerHandler.cpp file in our Sample App folder:
In the above code block, we can see the handlers for when the PowerController directive is received. You can see that the application prints out to the screen “TURN-ON” or “TURN-OFF” and also using the PowerControllerInterface to store the state of the PowerController.
Before we build, the one final piece we might be interested in is to inspect the Alexa.Discovery event that our application generates. You can add a logging statement of the Alexa.Discovery object so that you can see what is generated in case you want to create your own CapabilityAgents, and help better understand the Smart Home Discovery API.
In the CapabilitiesDelegate/src/PostConnectCapabilitiesPublisher.cpp file, within the MessageRequestObserverInterface::Status PostConnectCapabilitiesPublisher::sendDiscoveryEvent function, we added the following line in order to print out the Discovery JSON:
In order to use the new capability agents, you can update your CMake (link) with the following line to enable all four interfaces:
-DENABLE_ALL_ENDPOINT_CONTROLLERS=ON
Run your CMake and build your Sample App via the make command, as normal (if this is new to you, check our Getting Started guide for your system platform/OS).
Now when you launch your Sample App, you may receive a notification on your Alexa app or other Alexa device that a new device called “Discoball"" has been discovered.
If you enabled logging of the Discovery object above (and ran in at least DEBUG1 or lower), you should see a line similar to the following:
Try using it – from your Sample App, activate Alexa via tap-to-talk or use the wake word and say “turn on Discoball.” You should receive a directive to your Sample App and you should have output on your console output.
Similarly, if you try saying “turn off Discoball” you should receive a corresponding event for turning off Discoball.
Try some other utterances:

“set Discoball to green”
“set the speed to 7”
“set color to red”
“switch on the light”
“what is the speed of Discoball?”

Notice how we don’t always have to say “Discoball” on every utterance? This is due to the friendly name of the different properties (note that if you have an existing device named one of these values it may conflict. You can manage this in the Alexa app).
Since your Discoball sample device was discovered and is registered as a Smart Home device on your Alexa account, you can see the device within your Alexa app, get the current state, and change the values all through the app.
In the app, go to devices, all devices. Scroll down until you find the device “Discoball.” When you open it, you will see four attributes corresponding to the four interfaces you enabled: Power (PowerController), Speed (RangeController), Color (ModeController), and Light (ToggleController). Notice that when you open this screen on your Alexa app, your Sample App will start showing a number of “ReportState” directives coming in to your Sample App – these are requests from the Alexa app querying your device to understand the latest status. The SDK automatically responds with an Alexa.StateReport event containing the latest status. You can change the values via the Alexa app and your Sample App will receive the directives. Similarly, if you change one of the values via voice, the Alexa app will be updated shortly to reflect the updated status. You can also visit the Alexa Privacy Dashboard to learn about how customers can manage information related to their devices.
For this new capability, please note the updated certification guidelines for device controls. You can see the updated items on the AVS Certification checklist.
We are very excited about the new Smart Home for AVS capability and are looking forward to see how device makers are able to leverage it!

Get Your Alexa-Connected Devices to Market Even Faster with Expanded Self-Service Prototyping Using Alexa Connect Kit;Fri Mar 13 07:00:00 UTC 2020;Ben McInnis;"In September, we launched the general availability of Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) to enable device makers to connect devices to the Internet and Alexa using an Amazon-managed hardware module. With ACK, you don’t need to manage cloud services, create an Alexa skill, or write complex connectivity and security firmware. Today, we are excited to announce expanded self-service prototyping functionality with ACK. Now you can get your connected product to market even faster, reducing the time needed to prototype your product's Alexa voice and mobile app experience to just hours. Using ACK self-service prototyping tools you can easily create a virtual product, define its Alexa capabilities, and test your device's customer experience with Alexa.

When you add the Amazon-managed ACK module to your device, your customers get Alexa control in the Alexa app, and Wi-Fi simple setup. You can also choose to add the ability to support automatic reordering (Dash Replenishment Service) of consumables your product needs to keep running at its best, such as air-filters or coffee pods. The ACK module also stays up to date with silent, over-the-air firmware updates, and ACK’s managed cloud service meets the cloud reliability requirements of the Works with Alexa (WWA) certification program. After your device is certified, you can feature the WWA badge in the Amazon Smart Home Store and on product packaging, increasing customer confidence that your devices integrate seamlessly with Alexa.

To get started, purchase a development kit and visit our documentation guide on steps to prototype a product with ACK.
With ACK, you can make nearly any device a smart device while reducing development time and costs. Building with ACK gives you the advantages of:


Speed to Market. Significantly reduce your development time than earlier iterations of the ACK developer kit and go to market quickly. Create a virtual prototype using the ACK development kit, integrate into your device using the ACK module and device SDK, and move to volume manufacturing when you’re ready.
Implementation Ease. You don’t need to create or manage a cloud service, write an Alexa skill, or develop complex networking and security firmware. Simply add an Amazon-managed ACK module to your device, which uses Wi-Fi to securely connect your device to Amazon-managed cloud services that provide Alexa control, Wi-Fi simple setup, Dash Replenishment Service, and all the device metrics and logs you need to manage devices in the field. With an ACK module on your device, you can focus on building great hardware.
Cost Certainty. ACK enables more certain business planning with a low per-device total cost - less than $6 per device on average - that covers both the hardware module and ongoing use of the ACK cloud service. As a result, you don’t need to worry about unpredictable cloud infrastructure and usage costs.
This tutorial outlines the steps to create an Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) product prototype, using the example of a Smart Plug. First, the tutorial will provide an overview of what you need before you start prototyping a connected device. Then you will learn how to create and provision your ACK module as a virtual product in the ACK console and define the Alexa capabilities that your product will support. Finally, you will learn how to edit your virtual product in order to customize your prototype. Once completed, you will be able to test your prototype on your hardware and control it with the Alexa app.
To start building with Alexa Connect Kit, you will need a Development Kit or a printed circuit board assembly with an integrated ACK module. You can purchase a USI Development Kit for ACK on Amazon.com. The USI Development Kit for Alexa Connect Kit comes with a custom development board and integrated ACK module, an Arduino Zero development board, which represents a host microcontroller unit (HMCU), and a few other items. Once you have the Development Kit, you will need to complete the Get Started Guide: USI Development Kit.
Navigate to the ACK console Products page and click Create Product, then fill out the fields with your product’s information. Note you can edit this information at any time.
Product creation takes 20-25 minutes to complete. You'll see a banner in the products page while product creation is in progress.
Refresh the page to determine if product creation is complete. Once the virtual product is created, you will see a Success confirmation.
Next you’ll need to provision your ACK module as a virtual product via ACK managed services. ACK managed services provide partner and device-specific functionalities, such as Alexa capability management, and logging and metrics for your devices. Use the Module Utility command line interface (CLI) to provision your ACK module as your virtual product. To provision the module, you will use the provision command which moves the module state from module provisioned to product provisioned (see our documentation with Steps to Provision a Module). There are 4 steps to provisioning your ACK module:

Download your product’s configuration file:


Go to the ACK console products page.
Click on the product that you would like to provision the module as and download your provisioning file located in the top right of the console.

Use the Module Utility CLI to provision the ACK module:
To provision the module, you will use the provision command which moves the module state from module provisioned to product provisioned.


In the Module Utility command line interface (CLI),run the provision command, and specify the port that corresponds to the module and the location of the provisioning configuration file that you downloaded from the ACK console product page. Enter the following code into the terminal:
Generate a barcode for product registration:
ACK supports Amazon's Wi-Fi Simple Setup to make it easy for your users to register their devices with Amazon and Alexa services. In this step you’ll generate a barcode for your ACK module that enables registration through Wi-Fi Simple Setup.


Run the Module Utility CLI barcode command: barcode -p <port> --upc 12345678
You'll use file DVC_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.png when you register the module with Alexa in step 5.
Now that you’ve provisioned your device, it’s time to define your product’s capabilities. Alexa capabilities define the utterances your customers use with your product, as well as the Alexa app control page they interact with.

Here are some example products and associated Alexa smart home capabilities and utterances. To see more examples, review the Smart Home Skill Device Templates.
Use the JSON editor on your virtual product page to declare the Alexa capabilities that your product supports. By default, a virtual product comes with the PowerController capability. Each type of product has a number of recommended capabilities, but you can add whichever supported Alexa capabilities that you want.

To update your product’s Alexa capabilities:


Log in to your developer.amazon.com account, if you aren't already logged in.
Open the ACK console Products page.
Select the product that you'd like to customize.
Navigate to the Alexa smart home capabilities section in the Alexa capabilities tab.
Select Edit.
Choose and add capabilities as you'd like from the drop-down menu, or edit the JSON for existing capabilities.
Select Save

Update your smart home capabilities:
After customizing your product capabilities you can register your development kit with Alexa and try it out using voice and the Alexa mobile app. To register you'll scan the barcode you generated earlier in the tutorial.

How to register your device:


On your mobile device, open the Alexa app.
Select the Devices, and then select the plus sign (+).
Select Add Device.
From the list, select Development Device.
Under ""What brand is your development device?"" select ACK Module, and then click next.
If prompted, enable access to your mobile devices' Bluetooth, camera, and location services on your mobile device and then select next.
To register the development device with Alexa, use the Alexa app to scan the barcode you generated in step 3 (the DVC_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.png file) in order to register the development device with Alexa. The default ACK test device is called Development Device. If you don't have a barcode, or aren't able to successfully register your device using the barcode, refer to user guided setup to complete device registration.
Select the Wi-Fi network to connect to, and if necessary enter the Wi-Fi password.
After the ACK setup utility connects your module, you should see a notification that tells you that development device is set up and ready to use.
To get started, purchase a development kit today on Amazon.com and visit our documentation guide to start prototyping your product.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/03/Expanded-Self-Service-Prototyping-Using-Alexa-Connect-Kit;
Introducing Amazon Common Software for Devices (Preview): Accelerate Your Adoption of Amazon Device SDKs;Tue Feb 25 08:00:00 UTC 2020;Akashvir Mann;"Today, we are excited to announce Amazon Common Software (ACS) for Devices (Preview), an optimized software for integrating Amazon Device SDKs on your devices. We use ACS in Amazon devices, including the Echo Dot (3rd generation) and the Amazon Smart Oven. Now you can use it to accelerate integration of Amazon Device SDKs on your devices and bring them to market more quickly and cost-effectively. You can use ACS on Amazon-qualified reference platforms, such as ESP32 and Raspberry Pi 4, or integrate it on the hardware platform of your choice. ACS supports both FreeRTOS and Embedded Linux operating systems. Apply today to join the ACS preview.
ACS provides a unified API integration layer, pre-validated and memory optimized components for common functions such as connectivity, a device porting kit (DPK), and multi-tier test suites. The ACS preview includes support for Frustration-Free Setup (FFS) and AWS IoT Device SDKs, with support for the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Device SDK to come later in 2020.
“At Amazon, we understand the complexity and effort needed to develop and ship a high-quality connected device. ACS makes proven software from Amazon devices easier to use for device makers who want to quickly launch a device supporting Amazon Device SDKs, including FFS and AWS IoT SDKs,” says Joshua Danovitz, Director of ACS. “Now, device makers can focus on launching devices with innovative new features while significantly speeding up development time using ACS.”
One Integration Effort for Multiple SDKs
Integrating each device SDK typically requires you to implement the SDK’s API integration or compatibility layer for common functions including Wi-Fi management, HTTP operations, and cryptography. When the SDK needs to execute a task such as Wi-Fi network scanning, it calls your implementation of these functions. Today, API integration layers vary by SDK, and require a separate development and test effort for each SDK.
Now, ACS simplifies these SDKs’ integration. ACS provides a single, unified API integration layer for multiple Amazon Device SDKs. Once you implement an ACS API shared by multiple SDKs, you can re-use it with any SDK supported by ACS, saving you time and resources. Today, you can use ACS on two reference platforms (ESP32 and Raspberry Pi 4), or integrate it on the hardware platform of your choice using the Device Porting Kit (DPK). The DPK abstracts the hardware and operating system, allowing you to choose the hardware best suited for your specific use case and cost/performance needs.
Field Proven 
ACS provides pre-validated, memory-optimized components from Amazon devices for common functions such as connectivity, networking, authentication, and key-value store. ACS components are audited for security vulnerabilities in order to reduce security risks. You can use the components from Amazon, or implement your own. ACS software packages only include components needed for your device configuration and use cases. ACS configurations require RAM as little as 16 KB for Echo Flex third-party accessories and as little as 320 KB for smart home devices.

Testing and Updates
ACS includes extensive test suites that allow you to verify and debug your ACS implementation independently. ACS also provides you feature and security updates that are built with backward compatibility in mind. In many cases, you can drop in your updates and run ACS test suites in a few hours. These test suites allow you to ingest, test, and deploy updates easily.
We are working with solution providers to help you start using ACS more quickly and easily. “We were excited by how fast and easy it is to integrate Amazon Device SDKs using Amazon Common Software (ACS) for Devices,” says Gordon Goh, Vice President of Tonly Electronics. ""We look forward to using ACS in the future to launch products faster while simultaneously reducing our development costs"".
“We are pleased to be part of the ACS program and are excited to release our first Amazon-qualified ACS compatible development kit. This is going to make it even easier for device makers to use our products to build innovative connected devices using best-in-class Amazon Device SDKs,” says Denis Cabrol, GM of IoT Solutions, NXP Semiconductors.
Apply today to join the Amazon Common Software (ACS) for Devices preview and get updates on new features and services added to ACS. You can also check out our step by step video guides using the Raspberry Pi 4 or using the ESP32-WROVER Reference Kit.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/02/introducing-amazon-common-software-for-devices-preview;

Updates to Device Security Requirements for Alexa Built-in Products;Thu Jan 30 08:00:00 UTC 2020;Amit Agrawal;"Patrick McCanna also contributed to this article.
With the Alexa Voice Service (AVS), device makers can build Alexa Built-in products including smart speakers, smart TVs, hearables, and more. As the Alexa Built-in product selection grows and customers spend more time interacting with Alexa, we continue to look for opportunities to help device makers enhance security of their devices. Today, we released updated minimum security requirements for new AVS devices. You must have at least one AVS product created in the console to access this page. The list consolidates requirements for devices based on any of the available AVS SDKs, including the Alexa Smart Screen SDK and Alexa Auto SDK, to help device makers understand what steps they can take to improve the security of their products. The first set of requirements will go into effect August 1, 2020, and the next set will go into effect on August 1, 2021.
Hardware, Software, and Device Security Requirements
Securing devices requires a multifaceted approach in every step of the development process from product initiation to launch. Even after launch, device makers must release security fixes when the need arises. Required capabilities include:

Secure Boot can be used to reduce the risk that a hacker can tamper with and gain a persistent foothold on their device.
Secure Key Storage can be used to limit the exposure of authentication tokens and sensitive operations for attackers who’ve gained temporary access to a device.
Hardware-Based Cryptographic Engines can be used to reduce the risk of an attacker disrupting sensitive cryptographic operations, and accelerate the performance of cryptographic operations on the device.
Up-to-Date and Operating Systems with Long-Term Support (LTS) can reduce the risk of an attacker using old platform exploits to compromise a device.
Host Hardening can constrain the capabilities of an attacker targeting a device. You can consider using solutions like SELinux or AppArmor to reduce the blast radius of a successful compromise.
Separation of Account Privileges can reduce the risk of a successful exploit of a service or process leading to catastrophic compromise of the device.
Threat Surface Reduction (e.g. removing unnecessary network services) can help simplify the hardening process and reduce the risk of an unneeded service being used to exploit a device.
Connected devices rely on complex embedded operating systems and multiple layers of application software. Any time you add new features to an existing fleet of devices, you risk introducing new vulnerabilities to the device. Therefore, it is important that you develop a mature software maintenance strategy where you periodically patch vulnerabilities in software on your devices.
Start by evaluating potential threat scenarios by performing threat modeling for all features and use cases for your device. Your software development life cycle must include checks to evaluate if adequate authorization, authentication, and input sanitization mechanisms are being implemented for high-risk operations. Pick secure hardware and software components that are actively maintained and supported by your suppliers. Lastly, make sure to invest in the vulnerability discovery and management, bug bounty, and incident response mechanisms.
It is important to have both the right security expert within your company to establish secure design practices and an independent expert who can perform regular security assessments on production devices. We require device makers to submit a security assessment report before launch and every time there is a major change in the device software/firmware that triggers re-certification of your device. To help you with this, we have authorized security laboratories across the globe to assist and provide independent security assessments. You can reach out to the following security labs to get an assessment: Bishop Fox, NCC Group, Onward Security, Dekra, and Underwriters Laboratories.
We encourage you to review the updated security requirements on the developer portal. If you need to get in touch with any of the above laboratories or have any questions about security requirements for designing devices with Alexa Built-in, you can reach out to avs-security@amazon.com.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/01/updates-to-device-security-requirements-for-alexa-built-in-products;

2019 Alexa Developer Year in Review: New Products and Features to Help You Build More with Alexa ;Wed Dec 18 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Paul Cutsinger;"As 2019 comes to a close, we’re excited to reflect on all the developer community has done to make Alexa smarter and more engaging for customers. Today there are hundreds of thousands of developers and device makers building Alexa experiences, contributing to our growing catalog of more than 100,000 skills in the Alexa Skills Store, and more than 100,000 Alexa-compatible smart home devices. 
Customers are doing so much more with Alexa, thanks to your innovations across skills and devices. Customers interact with Alexa billions of times each week, and engagement with Alexa skills is up more than 100% since 2018, with skill categories like Productivity, Education & Reference, and Kids seeing triple digit growth. And customers have purchased more than 100 million Alexa devices. Your creations are building the voice economy with billions of dollars flowing to the Alexa developer and device maker community.
Our vision is to bring Alexa everywhere customers want to interact with her, and to help you, the developer community, find opportunities to reach more customers by building quality Alexa devices and engaging skills. In 2019, we’ve released new developer features — including new additions to the Echo family of devices, new monetization opportunities, and new and improved developer tools. Here are some of the highlights and new opportunities for voice developers and device makers in 2020.
Alexa is available on an ever-growing number of devices, whether they’re built by Amazon or by third-party companies creating devices with Alexa built-in. There are now hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built-in to enable voice-driven experiences for customers everywhere they are — at home, in the car, at work, and on the go. With new Amazon devices like Echo Buds, Echo Frames, and Echo Auto, you have an opportunity to build voice experiences that can engage customers outside the home. This growing selection of Alexa devices for customers means more opportunities for your Alexa skills to shine.
Now you can also reach more customers in more countries and languages. As Alexa keeps going global, there are new opportunities for developers and device makers to connect with customers around the world. In 2019, Alexa learned three new languages – US Spanish, Hindi, and Brazilian Portuguese – making the service available in 15 language/locale variations. And with the new Multilingual Mode, Alexa is able to switch between two languages to respond to customers in multilingual households more naturally. Find out how to update your Alexa skills to support the new US Spanish, Hindi, and Canadian French language models. Explore language- and region-specific services for device makers.
Alexa helps customers live at their best, and this year we introduced more ways developers can use Alexa to build helpful and convenient experiences. Now select US skill developers can build healthcare skills, allowing customers to access healthcare services – like booking a medical appointment, managing medication, accessing hospital post-discharge instructions, or checking on the status of a home delivery prescription order – more conveniently using voice. 
Education technology developers can use the new Alexa Education Skill API (preview) to integrate Alexa with education systems, such as learning management systems, and build voice experiences for parents and students 13 and older. 
Makers of smart devices can also bring Alexa into new form factors throughout the smart home. For example, with the updated Smart Home Skill API, Alexa can control more types of cooking appliances, from conventional ovens and pressure cookers to coffee makers and toasters. And now with updated smart home building block APIs, device makers can enable customers to more seamlessly control any feature of any smart home device. 
Device makers in the US can also take advantage of new inventory sensors in the Smart Home Skill API to ensure that customers always have the supplies required for their device to run at its best – such as printers (ink), thermostats (air filters), toothbrushes (toothbrush heads), and washing machines (detergent). By using inventory sensors in your smart home skill to provide consumption updates, Alexa will let customers know when supplies used by your device are running low or parts need replacement. Customers can also set up smart reordering through Dash Replenishment so that supplies are automatically reordered before they run out.
With Alexa available on an ever-growing number of devices, it’s important to ensure you’re delivering a seamless and engaging voice-first experience. To enable your skills to shine across device types, we made the Alexa Presentation Language (APL) generally available. Using APL, you can easily create visually rich Alexa skills for devices with screens and adapt them for different device types. Adding visuals and touch can make skills more engaging and interactive for customers. We also launched the Alexa Web API for Games (preview) to allow select game developers to create visually rich voice games using HTML and web technologies like Canvas 2D, WebAudio, WebGL, JavaScript, and CSS. Now developers can take advantage of existing web technologies to create voice-based games that customers can interact with via voice and touch. 
Developers can also make it easier for customers to interact with their favorite skills more automatically via Alexa routines. Rather than having to proactively remember a skill’s name to invoke it, customers can now invoke custom skills from Alexa routines, which are easy ways for Alexa to perform a series of actions at the same time, in a certain order. Being able to activate custom skills from routines was the top-voted item on our Alexa skills feature request site, and we’re excited to see more customers using your skills as part of their regular routines. 
In addition to tools to enhance the skill experience, we released new features device makers can use to make smart devices even easier for customers to set up, use, and maintain. We announced updates to the Frustration-Free Setup initiative, which enables customers to securely connect smart devices to their home networks by simply plugging them in. As a result, customers can start using their smart home devices faster, and you can reduce customer frustration, service call-in rates, and product returns. We also introduced Certified for Humans, a new certification program designed to help customers find smart home products that are easy to set up and work seamlessly with Alexa. By becoming part of the program, smart home device makers can deliver a better customer experience and potentially see increased traffic to certified products on Amazon.com that display the new Certified for Humans badge on product listings.
We also launched the Voice Interoperability Initiative, through which we work with companies on technology solutions that allow devices to support multiple wake words so users can summon the voice service of their choice.
Today there are hundreds of thousands of developers building for voice using the Alexa Skills Kit, our collection of self-service APIs, tools, documentation, and code samples. To streamline the skill-building process and simplify back-end development, we released Alexa-hosted skills, which enable you to build your voice interface, provision AWS cloud services, and publish a skill without leaving the Alexa Developer Console. For those who wish to create a skill without coding, they can now build and publish a skill directly to the Alexa Skills Store using Skill Blueprint templates.
We’re also making it easier for developers and manufacturers to integrate Alexa into their devices. Now with the Alexa Connect Kit (ACK), device makers can connect any device to the internet and Alexa using an Amazon-managed hardware module, without worrying about managing cloud services, Alexa skills, or complex networking and security firmware. To enable device makers to bring delightful voice experiences to customers on the go, we’ve also added new Alexa Mobile Accessory (AMA) features for building Alexa into mobility-focused devices like headphones, earbuds, headsets, and other Bluetooth devices. We also announced the general availability of Alexa Smart Screen Software Development Kit (SDK) version 2.0 along with qualified solutions from Broadcom and CommScope. The SDK enables device makers to bring rich Alexa visual experiences to voice-enabled products with screens. We also introduced more ways for automakers and suppliers to integrate Alexa into their vehicles using the Alexa Auto Software Development Kit (SDK). The updated SDK offers a full-suite of offline functionality, in addition to online functionality, for accessing Alexa in the car, helping keep customers entertained and productive—even when connectivity is intermittent or not available.
Additionally, the AVS Integration for AWS IoT Core is a new cost-effective solution for creating Alexa Built-in devices. The AVS Integration for AWS IoT Core makes it easier to add Alexa Built-in capabilities to products where embedding voice wasn’t previously viable, such as light switches, thermostats, and small appliances. This solution simplifies the device-side architecture of Alexa Built-in products by offloading complex processes to the cloud, made possible by leveraging Amazon AWS IoT Core, a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. 
We’re also making it easier for developers to build with Alexa through strategic solution providers, enabling device makers to leverage more complete hardware, software, services, and designs that are already pre-integrated with technologies needed to build and launch devices with Alexa. This year we announced new Systems Integrators (including C-Chip, Sagemcom, and StreamUnlimited) and Original Design Manufacturers (including SGW Global, Sirena Vood, Junlam, MyBox, BarbetSound, My Music Group, InnoMedia, Tatung, Horn, Third Reality, and Hansong). We also announced another solution provider this year: Consulting and Professional Services (CPS). CPS firms have the expertise to help device makers take Alexa Built-in products from concept to reality; they provide a range of services including consulting, prototyping, device design implementation, and large-scale solution implementation. We are also excited to release new and updated development kits from Microsemi, Synaptics, Qualcomm, NXP, XMOS, Knowles, and MediaTek. To help device makers select the right development kit, we launched a Development Kit Comparison Table that allows filtering and comparison across key metrics including the target application, platform architecture type, and supported features.
While it’s still the early days of voice technology, many developers, brands, and voice entrepreneurs are already capitalizing on Alexa’s reach. We even have skill developers making six figures each year. In 2019, we released more ways for developers to launch and grow a voice business through skill monetization. We expanded the availability of in-skill purchasing (ISP) in the UK, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, and Spain, and allowed developers to start monetizing Spanish-language skills in the US. Furthermore, developers can now enrich US kid skills with premium content using ISP, while maintaining purchase controls. Learn more about building a great monetized skill experience in our new training course, “How to Design for In-Skill Purchasing.”
These highlights are just some of the new features and tools you can use to build incredible voice experiences and Alexa-enabled devices for customers. For the full list of new Alexa Skills Kit features and tools launched in 2019, check out the Alexa skills release updates page. You can also check out developer and device maker announcements on the Alexa Developer Blog. 
Thank you for being part of the Alexa developer community and for making Alexa smarter every day. We can’t wait to see what you build with Alexa in 2020.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2019/12/2019-alexa-developer-year-in-review--new-products-and-features-t;
"""Alexa, Thank Smart Home Device Makers for a Great 2019!""";Wed Dec 18 08:00:00 UTC 2019;June Lee;"We celebrated Alexa’s fifth birthday earlier this year, and want to take a moment to celebrate how much you have delighted customers with the Alexa-compatible products you’ve built. You have now delivered more than 100,000 products from more than 9,500 brands that are compatible with Alexa!
You’ve innovated by delivering features like simple setup, which can make setting up devices as easy as just plugging them in, home Wi-Fi control, which lets customers say things like “Alexa, turn off Wi-Fi to John’s tablet,” brought Alexa to backyard grilling, which lets customers say things like “Alexa, what temperature is my grill set to”, and so much more.
You’ve also added Alexa control to brand new categories of devices, such as the Alexa compatible tree from Mr. Christmas, which raises the holiday spirit to new levels with controls like “Alexa, set my Christmas tree to candy cane,” and the Smart Coffee Maker from Hamilton Beach, which helps get the day started with a simple “Alexa, brew my coffee.”
As a result of your hard work, customers have now connected tens of millions of your smart devices to Alexa, and use Alexa to control them hundreds of millions of times each week. Thank you!
Many of you have already taken advantage of tools we provided in 2019 to make setting up, using, and even developing your devices easier.
In 2018, we announced the Frustration-Free Setup initiative, aimed at making setting up a smart home absolutely simple. This year, we released simple setup and app-to-app account linking to reduce the number of steps it takes customers to connect your Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and Bluetooth devices to their home network and to Alexa. With simple setup, you can make it possible for customers to connect your devices to their home networks by simply plugging them in. With app-to-app account linking, you can enable customers to link their Alexa account to your account from within your mobile application. TP-Link Kasa, Philips Hue, iRobot, Tuya Smart, IKEA, Sensi and eero are already taking advantage of these experiences, and you can too - when you make setting up your products easier, customers can take advantage of them more quickly, with fewer customer service contacts and fewer returns.
You can use a wide range new smart home features delivered this fall to do more for your customers with Alexa control.
You can use semantic extensions to enable additional voice commands that work with our toggle, mode, and range building block APIs to deliver more natural control with just a few lines of code. You can tell Alexa to map commands like “open”, “close”, “raise,” and “lower” to specific toggle, range, and mode directives for your device. For example, your customer can say “Alexa, open the garage door,” in addition to “Alexa, set the garage door mode to open.” beam Home and Nexx, are using semantic extensions for their garage door openers, and IKEA, Legrand, Lutron, Schellenberg, and Somfy are using them for their shades. You can also now use the building block APIs in nine additional Alexa locales, specifically Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and the UK.
You can use the enhanced cooking API to enable control of 40 cooking modes, as well as cooking by time, temperature, and more. Now your customers can say things like, “Alexa, preheat the oven to 350 degrees“ and “Alexa, defrost three pounds of meat in my microwave.” GE Appliance ovens, June Oven, and Traeger Grills are taking advantage of these new cooking capabilities today.
You can use the new networking API to enable customers to use Alexa to control your networking devices. With Alexa control, your customers can use their voices to quickly manage Wi-Fi access and other valuable features in your devices that previously required them to open a mobile app or web browser. For example, your customers can say, “Alexa, turn off Wi-Fi for John’s tablet” when it’s time for dinner, and “Alexa, enable the Internet for Sally’s phone for three hours.” Arris, ASUS, eero, Linksys, and TP-Link are already using the networking API.
You can use new inventory sensors and Alexa integration with the Dash Replenishment Service to let customers know when supplies used by your device are running low, and to set up automatic re-ordering of consumables when they’re needed. As a result, you can increase customer engagement and satisfaction with your devices, and create new monetization opportunities for your business. August Home, Blink, Coway, Ring, Schlage, and Yale use inventory sensors in their products and smart home skills.
You can use the Alexa Connect Kit, now generally available, to connect any device to the Internet and Alexa using an Amazon-managed hardware module, without worrying about managing cloud services, Alexa skills, or complex networking and security firmware. With ACK, you can build smart devices that customers will love - easily, quickly, and economically. The ACK hardware module provides Internet connectivity with simple setup, and lets you use Smart Home Skill API features like setting ranges, modes, and toggles, controlling cooking functions, and reporting inventory levels. ACK’s managed cloud service is built on AWS IoT, and meets the cloud reliability requirements for both Works with Alexa, and Certified for Humans certification. Crock-Pot, Eaton, Hamilton Beach, Leedarson, Midea, Mr. Christmas, Procter & Gamble, Tonly, and Amazon have already delivered products using ACK, and - whether you are a hobbyist or a multi-national corporation - you can order the ACK development kit and start building today.
You can connect your devices to Alexa using a wide variety of the most popular open standards and protocols, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and more. You can connect locally to an Echo device or Echo smart home hub, and you can build a smart home skill to connect from your cloud to Alexa. You can also connect devices to the Internet and Alexa using ACK and an Amazon-managed hardware module. You’ve used all of these options to do amazing things for customers:  you’ve built over 100,000 compatible devices from 9,500 brands; customers have connected tens of millions of your devices to Alexa, and they use Alexa to control them hundreds of millions of times each week. The possibilities for customers are endless, and we’ll continue to support and invest in broadly adopted standards that deliver a great customer experience.
Today, Amazon and the Zigbee Alliance, along with new members Apple and Google and other board members, announced a new working group that plans to draft a connectivity standard for IP-based devices to increase compatibility among smart home products. The working group invites everyone in the industry to bring their existing and new ideas to this nascent effort. Learn more here and join today, and visit our webpage for frequently asked questions.

This fall, we also introduced Amazon Sidewalk, a new effort to make it easy to connect low-bandwidth, low-power, smart lights, sensors, and other low-cost devices that customers install at the edge of their home network. Using the 900 MHz spectrum, we are developing a new protocol we project can increase the connection range of these devices by more than one half mile/one kilometer. With Amazon Sidewalk, customers will be able to place smart devices anywhere on their property and know they’ll work great, even in dead spots where Wi-Fi and Bluetooth don’t reach. For device makers, we plan to publish protocols that any manufacturer can use to build reliable, low-power, low-cost devices that benefit from access to long-range, low-bandwidth wireless connections. You can sign up to be notified when more information is available.
Thank you again for all you do on behalf of customers. We can’t wait to build with you in 2020!";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2019/12/alexa-thank-smart-home-device-makers-for-a-great-2019;
Alexa Smart Home Controls Now Available via Alexa Voice Service API;Tue Dec 10 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Brendon Wilson;"Today, Amazon is enabling Smart Home for AVS—an update to the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) API that enables voice control of smart home functionality on Alexa Built-in products. With this release, device makers can add support for Toggle, Mode, Range, and Power control APIs, previously enabled only for Smart Home Skill-based integrations.
Device makers have used AVS to launch hundreds of products with Alexa Built-in that customers can talk to and play music, ask questions, control compatible devices, and more. However, the only way for an AVS device maker to enable voice control of their product’s unique hardware was by building a separate Smart Home or Custom Alexa Skill for their device. Now with Smart Home for AVS, device makers can just re-use their AVS client to handle those Skill directives and events directly, saving time and money up-front and over the lifetime of the product. Developers can integrate the AVS API themselves directly, or can use the AVS Device SDK v1.17 to get started.
Support for these new building blocks in the AVS API significantly expands the set of experiences device makers can enable when building their Alexa devices. The API now supports the following additional capabilities:

Alexa.ToggleController: Enables Alexa to control binary on/off settings. By using the Toggle Controller interface, you can enable utterances like “Alexa, start the ice maker,” or “Alexa, disable the guest Wi-Fi.”
Alexa.RangeController: Provides integration for numeric settings. By using the Range Controller interface, you can enable utterances like ""Alexa, turn up the fan speed,"" or ""Alexa, what is the temperature of the shower?""
Alexa.ModeController: Provides integration for settings that can be one of several named states or modes. These possible modes may be ordered, like low/medium/high, or unordered, such as cycles of a washing machine. By using the Mode Controller interface, you can enable utterances such as “Alexa, set the air purifier to high”, or ""Alexa, set the wash cycle to delicates.""
Alexa.PowerController: Provides integration to control and report the power state of a device. By using the Power Controller interface, you can enable utterances like ""Alexa, turn on the robot vacuum"" or “Alexa, are the sprinklers off?”
These extensions enable device makers to deliver voice control for anything from simple devices like plugs, to complex home appliances like washers and dryers with several toggles, multiple groups of settings, and many modes of operation. With the recently announced non-controllable device states, developers can also use these building block API to define device states that customers can inquire about, but not control. For example, you could enable customers to ask, “Alexa, what is the surface temperature on the kitchen stove?” or “Alexa, what scent is my air freshener?”
Such AVS-based integrations don’t require a separate Smart Home or Custom Skill, so customers don’t need to take any additional actions to enable a Skill—they can start enjoying your devices more quickly. And by directly integrating these capabilities via AVS rather than a separate Skill, you reduce the number of network hops between the device and the Alexa cloud which translates into more responsive experiences for your customers.
Device makers that have an existing integration with Alexa via Smart Home Skills or AVS will not be affected by this new release. To start using these new capabilities, devices will need to transition from using the Capabilities API to Alexa.Discovery API to report their device’s capabilities. The AVS Device SDK v1.17 uses this new API without requiring any other code changes. The sample app included with the SDK illustrates how you can easily voice enable your device’s hardware features with Alexa. Get started today!

Update on New Smart Home Features Now Generally Available (GA);Tue Nov 26 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Metty Fisseha;"During our fall launch event, we announced previews for a number of Smart Home features to help you build even more exciting experiences for Alexa customers. Of the features we previewed, several are now Generally Available (GA), including semantic extensions, support for garage door controllers and shades, updates to the cooking API, inventory sensors and networking API. See below for a rundown of what each feature does, and resources to help you get started.
Last fall, we introduced toggle, range, and mode – each with their own general voice model – as building blocks for Smart Home developers to easily model a wider range of device functionality. Now, with the addition of semantic extensions (generally available), you can map these building blocks to specific voice models that better fit the device’s functionality.
We have launched four semantic extensions to support utterance that use “open”, “close,” “raise,” and “lower” commands, which are more natural ways for your customers to speak to their smart home devices. Examples of how these semantic extensions can be used are “Alexa, open the window” and “Alexa, lower the movie screen.” These new semantic extensions can be used to deliver seamless control of devices such as projector screens, windows, water valves, closets, drawers, garage doors, gates, curtains, shades, blinds, awnings, and more.
To get started with semantic extensions, check out the technical documentation here. You can refer to the preview announcement of semantic extensions here.
The semantic extensions “open”, “close,” “raise,” and “lower” are especially relevant to garage doors and shades. With these extensions, garage door and shades developers can now fulfill requests across a wider, more intuitive variety of commands. Garage door openers from Nexx will be Alexa-enabled, designed using the mode controller, with open and close semantic extensions (coming soon) to support phrases such as “Alexa, close the garage door”. Additionally, shades from IKEA are now live and can be controlled using semantic extensions, with shades from Lutron and Schellenberg coming soon. Customers can say things like “Alexa, raise the <device name>”, “Alexa, lower the <device name> halfway”, “Alexa, open the <device name> to 80%” and more.
To get started with using these new semantic extensions, check out the technical documentation for garage door openers here and for shades here. You can refer to the preview announcement of semantic extensions here.
Last year, we introduced cooking capabilities in the Smart Home Skill API that allow you to enable customers to control microwave ovens and other appliances that cook by time or preset. Now, we are releasing enhanced cooking capabilities (generally available) which allow you to enable Alexa control of conventional ovens, pressure cookers, coffee makers, toasters, slow cookers, and more, and to enable Alexa customers to check cooking progress from other rooms in the house. GE Appliance ovens, June Oven, and Traeger Grills are all taking advantage of these new cooking capabilities today.
With this release, Alexa Smart Home developers now have access to 40 new modes, including air-fry, bake, pressure cook, roast, and slow cook, and can enable customer commands like ""Alexa, cook ribeye steak to medium rare in the oven."" Additionally, you can use the Alexa Cooking TemperatureController to enable customers to set the temperature on a device without specifying a duration (e.g. “Alexa, preheat the oven to 350 degrees,”) cook food until it reaches a given internal temperature (e.g. “Alexa, smoke the pork to 204 degrees in the smoker,”) and even combine mode, temperature, and time in one command (e.g. ""Alexa, bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.”)
Lastly, with the Alexa Cooking TemperatureSensor and FoodTemperatureSensor, you can enable customers to ask on the current status of their food by voice. For example, a customer could say, “Alexa, what is the temperature of my oven?” or “Alexa, when will the food be done in the oven?”
To get started with using these new enhancements to the Cooking API, check out the technical documentation here. You can refer to the preview announcement here.
With inventory sensors, Alexa will let customers know when supplies used by your device are running low or parts need replacement. To further simplify the process of (re)ordering, customers can set up smart reordering through Dash Replenishment so that supplies are automatically reordered before they run out.
Any connected Alexa Smart Home device that requires the use of a consumable or has replacement parts can take advantage of inventory sensors. This can include printers (ink), thermostats (air filters), toothbrushes (toothbrush heads), washing machines (detergent), dishwashers (detergent), vacuum cleaners (dust bags, brushes), and more. Inventory sensors allow you to ensure that your customers always have the supplies required for their device to run at its best.
To get started with using inventory sensors, check out the technical documentation here. You can refer to the preview announcement here.
With the new networking API, you can build the capability to enable your customers to manage Wi-Fi access for devices through voice. Customers can ask Alexa to restrict Wi-Fi access for individual devices or for groups of devices, so they can pause access for specific family members. They can say “Alexa pause the Wi-Fi” to pause Wi-Fi access for all devices when it’s time for dinner, or “Alexa turn off Wi-Fi for PlayStation” or “Alexa, turn off Daniel’s Wi-Fi” to restrict access for specific devices. Customers can also say “Alexa, enable guest Wi-Fi” when relatives visit.
Using Alexa routines, customers can also schedule Wi-Fi time limits for kids and automatically pause Wi-Fi during bedtime or homework time. Manufacturer eero has already launched their skill using the networking API, with more skills on the way from TP-Link and ASUS over the coming weeks, and support for Linksys and Arris routers coming soon. To get started with the networking API, check out the technical documentation here. You can refer to the preview announcement here.
We are excited to see how you use these features to build some incredible experiences for Alexa Smart Home customers!";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2019/11/update-on-new-smart-home-features-that-are-now-generally-availab;
Introducing Alexa Voice Service Integration for AWS IoT Core, A Cost-Effective Solution for Devices with Alexa Built-in;Mon Nov 25 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Gagan Luthra;"Device makers have used the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) to create products that bring voice-first, ambient computing experiences to customers everywhere. There are now hundreds of different Alexa Built-in products that customers can talk to, ranging from multi-room speakers and soundbars, to headphones, PCs, TVs, and more. Today, we are pleased to introduce the AVS Integration for AWS IoT Core, a new cost-effective way to bring Alexa voice capabilities to all types of connected devices.
The AVS Integration for AWS IoT Core makes it easier and more cost-effective to add Alexa Built-in capabilities to products where embedding voice wasn’t previously viable, such as light switches, thermostats, and small appliances. This solution simplifies the device-side architecture of Alexa Built-in products by offloading complex processes to the cloud. This is made possible by leveraging Amazon AWS IoT Core, a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AVS interfaces are now accessible via a single, secure AWS IoT reserved topic for MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) a lightweight communication protocol. The resulting on-device code for the Alexa client can run on microcontroller-class processors with <1MB embedded memory, instead of the application-class processors with >50MB memory required for typical AVS Device SDK based integrations. In addition, device makers have access to simpler device management, strengthened device security, and rich analytics via easy to use AWS IoT services. Learn more about the new AVS Integration for AWS IoT Core on the AWS Developer Blog.
Amazon has worked with leading chipset providers Qualcomm and NXP to qualify their hardware-based reference solutions that make is easier for device makers to get started with AVS for AWS IoT Core. Qualcomm has introduced the Qualcomm Home Hub 100 Dev Kit -- This kit is based on the QCA4020 SoC, an ARM Cortex-M4 MCU with integrated Bluetooth / WiFi hosting the Alexa client, paired with a Synaptics voice processor for far-field voice capture. NXP has introduced the NXP i.MX RT MCU AVS Solution, featuring the i.MX-RT1060A ARM Cortex-M7 based crossover processor that hosts both the Alexa client and the far-field audio front end on a single chip running Amazon FreeRTOS. Learn more about qualified development kits for AVS on the AVS Developer Portal.

Announcing the General Availability of Alexa Smart Screen SDK for TVs, Smart Displays, and More;Tue Nov 19 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Gagan Luthra;"Today, we are excited to announce the general availability of Alexa Smart Screen SDK v2.0. The SDK enables device makers to bring rich Alexa visual experiences to voice-enabled products with screens. Last year we announced the preview of the SDK and have since enhanced its capabilities to deliver a richer experience for customers. We are also introducing qualified solutions (based on the new SDK) from Broadcom and CommScope to help accelerate product development and time to market. The Alexa Smart Screen SDK is C++ based and available on GitHub along with sample apps for Raspberry Pi3 and MacOS.
The Alexa Smart Screen SDK has been optimized for television viewing experiences (on smart TVs, set-top boxes, soundbars, AV receivers, etc.). The SDK offers native integration of Alexa functionality with TVs and supports adaptive visual responses to minimize interruption. Device makers can render partial screen-responses when the TV is playing video, and full-screen responses when the TV is idle.
“Customers love interacting with visually rich, voice-enabled products throughout their home. As we’ve seen with the recent LG TV integration, the Alexa Smart Screen SDK makes it easier than ever for device makers to build visual products with Alexa,” said Nedim Fresko, vice president of Alexa Devices. “The SDK enables developers to natively integrate Alexa functionality with the device’s UX, so manufacturers can make Alexa feel at home on televisions.”
With the launch of Echo Show, Amazon pioneered multimodal voice-forward experiences that augmented Alexa’s existing voice-only experience with rich visuals that make it even easier to consume information. The Alexa Smart Screen SDK builds on the capabilities of the AVS Device SDK and supports visual experiences for:

Music: Discover and play music from Amazon Music, TuneIn, iHeartRadio, Pandora
Information: Ask Alexa questions, info from Wikipedia, hear a joke, the weather forecast, and more
Household Organization: Ask Alexa what’s on your To-Do list or add items to your shopping lists, check your calendar
Alexa Skills: Interact with your favorite skills like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Food Network, CNBC, and more
Video Skill API: Control your video experience by voice. Control video devices and consume content by leveraging the Video Skill API.
Much More: More Alexa visual experiences will be added with frequent updates to the SDK, including smart home cameras, visual shopping, and many more.
The Alexa Smart Screen SDK includes a new core rendering engine for Alexa Presentation Language (APL). APL is the common design language for the Echo family and 3rd party screen-based Alexa devices. Through APL, developers can build interactive voice skills that include images, slideshows, video, vector graphics, and animation. The SDK’s APL engine supports rendering in a web browser and includes sample implementations for Raspberry Pi and MacOS that package everything to get you up and running quickly.
Alexa Smart Screen SDK powers LG’s award winning OLED, NanoCell, and UHD Alexa built-in TVs, enabling TV customers to see a live feed of their smart camera, look up weather and get access to 100,000+ skills. Support for interactive Alexa visuals using Alexa Presentation Language (APL) means customers get more out of their TV.  For instance, LG Alexa built-in TV customers can book tickets (“Alexa, open Kayak”), view video recipes (“Alexa, open Food Network”), play games (“Alexa, open play who wants to be a millionaire”) and more.

“We are excited to offer Alexa to our Smart TV customers,” said SP Baik, head of LG’s TV Product Strategy. “Alexa helps our customers get more out of their TV, whether it be playing music from a variety of providers, shopping, smart home controls, interactive skills and more. The Alexa Smart Screen SDK, with its stunning visuals for services such as weather, highlights the award winning picture quality of our TVs”.
The Broadcom BCM972180 Voice STB Development Kit for AVS enables device makers to create set top boxes with Alexa built-in. It is the first kit with a STB system-on-chip (SoC) that supports far-field voice and leverages the Smart Screen SDK. This solution features the BCM72180 STB SoC, a quad-core processor with support for 4K/60p 10-bit video and multi-channel audio. The kit includes form-factor reference hardware with 2 microphones and Broadcom's audio front end algorithms processed directly on the SoC (no external DSP required). It also includes Broadcom’s Nexus Set-Top Box reference software stack (for Linux or RDK) and comes pre-integrated with Broadcom's audio front end, the Amazon wake word engine, and the Alexa Smart Screen SDK.
“The Broadcom Voice STB development kit for AVS offers a compelling solution for bringing Alexa to television viewing experiences”, said John Gleiter, VP of STB Marketing at Broadcom. “Our work on integrating the Broadcom Nexus software stack with Amazon’s Alexa Smart Screen SDK will dramatically reduce the development effort for set-top-box operators to integrate Alexa voice and visuals. This highly optimized solution provides best-in-class Alexa far-field performance and reduces cost by integrating Broadcom’s audio algorithms inside the BCM72180.”
CommScope/ARRIS, a global leader in entertainment and communications solutions, is an AVS-qualified systems integrator that combines hardware, software and services to enable advanced video experiences with the Alexa Smart Screen SDK. They support enabling Alexa built-in solutions for service providers, commercial verticals, and enterprises.


“Voice control has positively changed the way people interact with their homes, and now the Alexa Smart Screen (SDK) enables us to expand on this, adding engaging visual consumer experiences,” said Charles Cheevers, chief technology officer for Customer Premises Equipment at CommScope. “We are working to bring Alexa into the home in multiple ways including using our smart media device (SMD) concept to give service providers one solution to bring together multiple connected smart devices throughout the home, and in the case of our SMD soundbar, these experiences are paired with larger-than-life audio quality too. The SMD7852 is our next generation Wi-Fi 6 enabled SMD with Alexa Smart Screen SDK support that allows richer converged experiences in the home through the Commscope Home Command Center portal.”
Device makers can get started with the Alexa Smart Screen SDK today. Start development with the SDK source on GitHub with included sample apps for Raspberry Pi3 and MacOS, review technical documentation including functional requirements and design guides, or procure a development kit for commercial products.

Build Gadgets, Games, and Smart Toys with the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit – Now Available Everywhere;Mon Oct 28 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Lisa Mohanty;"Today, we are excited to announce that the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit is now available in all locales where Alexa-enabled devices are sold. Now, developers in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have the opportunity to build Echo companion devices – unlocking fun and delightful experiences for their customers.
Around the world, customers interact with Alexa billions of times each week – requesting important information, setting timers and alarms, playing their favorite music, and much more. With the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit, you can build companion devices that either enhance Alexa’s capabilities, or create a new interactive experience between the product, Alexa, and the customer. Whether you choose to create a smart toy, smart clock, or novelty accessory, the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit enables you to bring delight, entertainment, and utility to your customers.
The Alexa Gadgets Toolkit offers self-service APIs and interfaces that expose metadata of Alexa’s capabilities through compatible Echo devices. Use Custom Interfaces to create interactive two-way communication between your product and its paired Echo device, or choose from several Defined Interfaces to build a product that reacts in response to some of Alexa’s most popular capabilities.
Custom Interfaces: Create dynamic interactions and immersive experiences that are unlocked when your product is connected to a compatible Echo device. This API provides a private channel between your companion device and an associated custom Alexa skill, allowing you to create a unique product experience for your customers, regardless of locale or language. To help you get started, here are just a few ideas for products you could build for customers across the globe:

Create a mini keyboard for customers in Spain. Using Alexa as a piano teacher, you can enable the keyboard to illuminate keys that correspond to a prescribed musical sequence and provide feedback on whether the correct notes have been played. Learn more
Build an Alexa-connected table football for customers in Germany. You can enable interactive experiences such as a scoreboard that lights up when a user says “Alexa, sag Fußball Game, er soll ein Spiel starten,” or sounds to emulate a crowd cheering when a user scores.  
Design an indoor drone for customers in Australia, India, or the United Kingdom. You can enable the drone to navigate the room and respond to commands like, “Alexa, tell my drone to fly in a figure-eight,” or play a tune when the drone is descending for landing.
Defined Interfaces: Build a companion device that responds to Alexa's native capabilities, such as setting timers, receiving notifications, playing music, and more. When building Echo Wall Clock, Amazon leveraged Defined Interfaces to extend the utility of Alexa timers, alarms, reminders, and notifications with unique visual responses. The current list of available interfaces includes:

Wake Word Detection: Respond when the wake word is detected, such as a cuckoo clock that pops its head out whenever a customer says, “Alexa.”
Speech: Sync physical movement to Alexa’s text-to-speech, such as a robot that lip syncs as Alexa reads the local weather report in the language of your preference.
Time Info & Alerts: Respond to time or when a timer, alarm or reminder has been set or triggered, such as an outdoor gong that chimes when a backyard playtime timer has concluded, or a switch that releases dog food each time an alarm has expired. View sample
Notifications: React to the notification capabilities of Alexa such as an alert flag that raises when a notification is received by your Echo device, and lowers when all notifications are listened to or cleared. View sample
Music (Beta): Create visual performances for your customers as they listen to their favorite song on Amazon Music, such as a hula dancer figurine that moves while songs are played on a customer’s Echo device.

The Alexa Gadgets Toolkit also includes technical documentation and sample code to facilitate direct pairing and connectivity, communication, and over-the-air (OTA) updates between your product and its paired Echo device.
To get started with the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit, you can access our Raspberry Pi and Python-based solution that includes sample applications and step-by-step guides that simplify the process of getting your prototype connected and ready to respond.

Coming Soon: Updated Smart Home Skill API Enables Alexa to Control More Types of Cooking Appliances;Fri Oct 11 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Sumiko Courtney;"Last year, we introduced cooking capabilities in the Smart Home Skill API that allow you to enable customers to control microwave ovens and other appliances that cook by time or preset. Coming soon, we are enhancing the cooking capabilities to allow you to enable Alexa control of conventional ovens, pressure cookers, coffee makers, toasters, slow cookers, and more, and to enable customers to check cooking progress from other rooms in the house using Alexa. GE Appliances, Instant Pot, June Oven, LG, Traeger, and Whirlpool are already working with the updated API. Next year, we will also enable you to use Alexa to make announcements on cooking status and to support Scan-to-Cook for packaged foods.
Cook by Mode, Time, Temperature, and Doneness
Currently, the cooking interface supports four cooking modes: defrost, preset, reheat, and timecook. Coming soon, you can use 40 different modes, including air-fry, bake, pressure cook, roast, and slow cook, and can enable customer commands like ""Alexa, cook ribeye steak to medium rare in the oven."" We're also adding the ability for you to enable direct control of the oven temperature and food temperature. With the new Alexa.Cooking.TemperatureController, you can enable customers to set the temperature on a device without specifying a duration, by saying, for example, “Alexa, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.“ This is particularly useful for devices that need to preheat, like an oven or sous-vide. With the new Alexa.Cooking.FoodTemperatureController, you can enable customers to cook food until it reaches a given internal temperature. For example, a customer can say, “Alexa, smoke the pork to 204 degrees in the smoker.” Your customers can even combine mode, temperature, and time, with commands like ""Alexa, bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes.""
Use Alexa to Report Cooking Status
In addition to enabling customers to control your cooking devices with Alexa, soon you can enable them to check on appliance status and cooking progress without even entering the kitchen. When you implement the new Alexa.Cooking.TemperatureSensor and Alexa.Cooking.FoodTemperatureSensor, you enable customers to query current status by voice. For example, a customer could say, “Alexa, what is the temperature of my oven?” or “Alexa, when will the food be done in the oven?” 
Next year, we will enable you to initiate Alexa announcements from your device to proactively alert customers at important moments, such as when the oven is done preheating, the food needs to be stirred, or dinner is done. This allows customers to start the cooking process, and then move on to other tasks, knowing that your device and Alexa will alert them when needed. For example, the customer may use the chicken breast preset, “Alexa, cook chicken breast in my oven”, to start heating the oven to the preset temperature. When the desired temperature has been reached, Alexa will say, “Your oven is preheated,” so the customer knows to add the food. When the chicken pieces need to be flipped halfway through baking, the device can announce through Alexa, “It’s time to flip your food,” and, when the food is done cooking, Alexa can announce, “Your food is done.”
Automate the Cooking Process with Scan-to-Cook
Scan-to-Cook allows customers to scan a box of food with their phone, pop it in the oven and let the oven take care of the rest of the cooking, automatically setting the mode, cook time and temperature. Next year, you'll be able to enable customers to use Scan-to-Cook with your cooking appliance via Alexa. When a customer uses the Alexa app to scan their packaged food item, Alexa will send a cooking directive to your smart home skill containing the scanned Universal Product Code (UPC) and the cooking instructions for the food. Backing the Scan-to-Cook capability is a database containing cooking instructions for hundreds of packaged foods from brands including Whole Foods Market, 365 Everyday Value, Gardein, Marie Callender’s, and more. Consumer packaged goods (CPG) food manufacturers add new scannable foods to the database every day.
Get Inspired by Other Device Makers
The following products, coming soon, take advantage of the updated cooking APIs:

All of GE Appliance's Smart Cooking brands and products, including wall ovens, ranges, microwaves and Advantium ovens.
Wifi 6 Quart Multi-cooker from Instant Pot.
June Oven from June.
SmartThinQ ovens and ranges from LG.
WiFIRE connected grills from Traeger, featured on the new Pro, Ironwood, and Timberline series.
Smart ovens and ranges from Whirlpool.

""With the new Alexa Cooking API, specifying cook instructions is easier and more intuitive than ever. On the June Oven, we predict how long it will take for your food to be ready. We can share that ETA, estimated time of arrival, by simply asking ""Alexa, when will the food in my oven be done?"" said Matt Van Horn, CEO at June.
Also, the Amazon Smart Oven, available for pre-order now, takes advantage of the updated cooking API, device initiated announcements, and scan-to-cook to deliver a 4-in-1 convection oven, microwave, air fryer, and food warmer that works with Alexa. We built the smart oven using the Alexa Connect Kit and the updated cooking APIs (coming soon), and took learnings from the smart oven effort to improve both products.

Announcing Simple Setup for Your Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and Bluetooth (Preview) Devices;Wed Sep 25 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Quentin Robinson;"We’re excited to announce the general availability of simple setup for Wi-Fi and Zigbee devices, and a preview of simple setup for Bluetooth devices coming soon. With simple setup, you can enable customers to securely connect your devices to their home networks simply by plugging them in. As a result, your customers can take advantage of your products more quickly - and you can reduce customer frustration, service call-in rates, and product returns. With today’s announcement of simple setup and last month’s announcement of app-to-app account linking, we invite you to join us on the next steps of the Frustration-Free Setup initiative we announced last year.
How Simple Setup Works
Customers can choose to enable simple setup during check-out when they purchase one of your devices from Amazon.com. If a customer enables simple setup, we automatically associate a unique ID for your device with the customer’s account. When your device is plugged in and attempts to connect to a customer’s network, simple setup confirms whether the customer purchased your device and provided the permissions necessary for simple setup. Once this is confirmed, simple setup securely transfers any required credentials, and your device and other devices on the customer’s network can complete any local steps required for connection. The specific steps vary based on whether your device uses Wi-Fi, Zigbee, or Bluetooth.
Wi-Fi simple setup requires that the customer previously stored their Wi-Fi credentials on Amazon, that the customer has linked their account with your service to their Amazon account, and that the customer’s network includes a simple setup provisioner, such as an Amazon Echo or Fire TV device. When powered on, your device looks for a provisioner, and if found, establishes a secure connection through the provisioner to the Amazon device setup service in the cloud. We’ll confirm customer ownership of your device, the required enablement, and then return the customer’s Wi-Fi credentials (encrypted). Once you decrypt these credentials on your device, you can use them to connect to the customer’s Wi-Fi network. In our testing with early adopters, most completed the process in under a minute.
David Li, CEO of TP-Link Kasa has already enabled Wi-Fi simple setup for their HS105. “We’ve worked hard to make the setup experience as simple as possible from the very beginning. Adding Wi-Fi simple setup from Amazon, we’ve been able to take our straightforward onboarding process and turn it into a truly magical experience. From our development team’s perspective, integrating the Wi-Fi simple setup SDK was quick and easy, making deciding to add FFS all the more obvious.”
Zigbee simple setup allows you to connect to the Zigbee hub built into Echo Plus and Echo Show using a similar approach. While we do not use Wi-Fi credentials, we still authenticate and authorize your device via the setup service backend before sending local Zigbee or Bluetooth install codes from the provisioner device. Echo Plus and Echo Show can automatically discover and enable Alexa use of Zigbee devices with simple setup, without even requiring the customer to say, “Alexa, discover my devices.”
How to Integrate Simple Setup
To integrate simple setup, you’ll need to take several steps:
First, you’ll integrate simple setup functions into your device firmware using the simple setup SDK. Then test your firmware and devices, and submit them for certification in the developer console. Add app-to-app account linking to your mobile applications if not already present, and ensure that the barcodes on your packaging meet the simple setup specification. The barcode lets us associate your specific device with the customer that purchased it, a critical step in the simple setup process.
If you’re using the Alexa Connect Kit (ACK), many of these steps are done for you. ACK devices use an Amazon certified chipset, a backend that is simple setup ready, and tools to create and manage barcodes. You can review the entire process for Wi-Fi and Zigbee devices in our documentation. You can access the Bluetooth simple setup developer preview by heading over to the Frustration-Free Setup developer console and signing up here.
Delight Your Customers with Simple Setup
Since announcing the Frustration-Free Setup initiative last year, we’ve included simple setup in multiple Amazon devices. We’ve seen higher customer satisfaction, including a 4.5 star rating on the Amazon smart plug. With simple setup, you can accelerate customer use of your devices and reduce frustration, service calls, and returns.

Announcing Updated Smart Home Building Block APIs: Non-Controllable Device States, Semantic Extensions and Expanded International Support;Wed Sep 25 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Fahad Siddiqui;"Last fall we introduced toggle, mode, and range building block APIs to enable seamless voice control of any feature of any device. Since then, device makers have used building block APIs to build new devices with more features than ever that are easy to control with Alexa, from Moen's U by Moen smart shower to Dyson's Pure Hot + Cool purifying fans. Today, we are excited to announce three updates to these building block APIs. Starting today, you can use the APIs to define non-controllable device states that customers can query, but not control. Coming soon, you will be able to use building block APIs in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain and UK as well as the US. Finally, coming soon, you will also be able to use semantic extensions in English and German that enable customers to use “open,” “close,” “raise,” and “lower” commands to control your toggle, mode, and range settings. This update will give you access to a wider range of Alexa customers looking for smart devices, and higher customer satisfaction from customers who already own one of your devices.
 
Enable Customers to Query Status Using Non-Controllable Device States
Now, you can use the nonControllable property with building block APIs to define device states that customers can inquire about, but not control. For example, you could enable customers to ask, “Alexa, what is the surface temperature on the kitchen stove?” “Alexa, what is the wash cycle on the washing machine?” and “Alexa, what scent is my air freshener?” Hamilton Beach is using the mode capability along with non-controllable states for the Alexa Enabled Smart Coffee Maker to let customers know the approximate time since the coffee was brewed.
The code snippet below shows how easy it is to add a state that indicates a device needs to be cleaned. This example indicates that the coffee machine can report on a non-controllable mode called CleaningState. Customers can ask, “Alexa, what is the cleaning state of my coffee machine?” and they will receive a response such as, “the coffee machine is set to needs cleaning.” If customers try to control the cleaning state, Alexa will notify them that their device does not support that functionality. You will not have to handle an unnecessary control directive.
Get started with voice query support today for non-controllable states by reviewing the documentation for mode, range and toggle building block APIs.


Use Toggle, Mode, and Range Building Block APIs in Additional Alexa Locales
Today, the building block APIs are available using English in the US. Coming soon, we will expand English language support for these APIs in four new countries (Canada, India, UK and Australia), as well as launch support for Spanish (in Spain and Mexico), German, French and Italian. For example, your customers who speak German will be able to say “Alexa, Setze geschwindigkeit auf maximum” (“Alexa, Set the speed to maximum”) and your customers who speak Italian will be able to say “Alexa, imposta la lavatrice a modalità delicata” (“Alexa, Set washing machine to delicate mode”). To make it easier for you to extend your skills to new languages and countries, we’ve localized the asset names we include in our global Alexa catalog so you don’t have to localize the names of your device settings for each language you want to support. Simply declare Alexa.Setting.FanSpeed as a friendlyName and your customers can refer to your setting as “vitesse” in French and ”Flujo de aire” in Spanish. The Pure Hot + Cool purifying fans from Dyson will be Alexa enabled in Canada, Germany, UK, India and Australia by utilizing new country and language support.
To add support for additional languages, simply update the language settings for your smart home skill on the Alexa Developer Console by 1) selecting the languages you want your device to support 2) configuring the settings for each language on the Build and Distribution pages 3) deploying lambda function to multiple regions 4) submitting skill for certification review. For detailed instructions please visit our developer website.
 
Enable More Natural Control with Open, Close, Raise, and Lower Semantic Extensions
We introduced toggle, range, and mode, each with their own general voice model, to give developers building blocks to easily model a wide range of device functionality. Now we are adding semantic extensions (coming soon) that give you the ability to map these building blocks to specific voice models that better fit your device’s functionality. The first semantic extensions (coming soon) enable you to support utterances that use “open”, “close,” “raise,” and “lower” commands such as “Alexa, open the window” and “Alexa, lower the movie screen”. These new semantic extensions (coming soon) can be used to deliver natural control of devices such as projector screens, windows, water valves, closets, drawers, garage doors, gates, curtains, shades, blinds, awnings, and more.
Smart shades from Lutron, Schellenberg and IKEA will be Alexa-enabled, designed to use the open, close, raise and lower semantic extensions (coming soon). This enables them to support phrases such as “Alexa, open the shades”, and “Alexa, raise the shades halfway”. Garage door openers from Nexx and beam Home will be Alexa-enabled, designed using the mode controller, along with open and close semantic extensions (coming soon) to support phrases such as “Alexa, close the garage door”.
The example below shows how to map semantic extensions (coming soon) to specific mode settings using the Smart Home Skill API. Customers can say “Alexa, open the trash can” freeing their hands for disposal. Since the trash can’s lid can be opened or closed, we used the mode capability, by specifying the interface Alexa.ModeController. We then added the semantic mappings to the SetMode directive, by annotating Alexa.Actions.Open to with the OPEN payload, and Alexa.Actions.Close with the CLOSE payload.
While the above example focuses on the mode interface, you can also integrate other types of devices that support numerical or binary values. For instance, you can map Alexa.Actions.Open to setRangeValue 100 for a projector screen to support “Alexa, open the projector screen”. You can also map Alexa.Actions.Raise to AdjustRangeValue to support the phrase “Alexa, raise the screen”.

Coming Soon: Alexa Smart Home Developers Can Make their Customers' Lives Easier by Helping Them Never Run Out of Supplies – and Earn Revenue in the Process;Wed Sep 25 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Prashanth Halappa;"Today, we are excited to announce new inventory sensors (coming soon) in the Smart Home Skill API that enable developers in the US to ensure that customers always have the supplies required for their device to run at its best, and earn revenue while doing so. Any connected device that uses a consumable - such as printers (ink), thermostats (air filters), toothbrushes (toothbrush heads), washing machines (detergent), dishwashers (detergent), or has replacement parts - such as vacuum cleaners (dust bags, brushes) - can take advantage.

You simply use inventory sensors in your smart home skill to provide consumption updates and Alexa does the rest. Alexa will let customers know when supplies used by your device are running low or parts need replacement. Customers can also set up smart reordering through Dash Replenishment so that supplies are automatically reordered before they run out. For example, thermostat developers can enable smart reordering of air filters so that their customers always breathe clean air and stay healthy.
You will be leveraging Amazon's retail capabilities to build smart reordering experiences for your customers. You can take advantage of Amazon's authentication and payment systems, customer service, and fulfillment network to ensure your customers never have that “ran out of it” moment. You will generate recurring revenue when customers reorder supplies through low supply notifications and when smart reorders are placed.
August, Blink, Ring, Schlage and Yale are already working on including inventory sensors to report battery levels from their skills, and Coway is working to report the usage of air filters. Coming soon, all developers in the US can use inventory sensors.
 
Simple for Customers
When you report inventory using the Smart Home Skill API, Alexa will help customers manage their household supplies. Alexa can let customers know when they are running low on supplies or enable them to set up smart re-ordering in the Alexa app. Amazon keeps track of customer inventory based on the consumption data you provide using the Inventory Sensor and customer orders placed on Amazon.com. For example, Alexa can reorder ink for printers so that customers always have the right ink to print their documents. 
As shown below, customers can set up smart reordering through Dash Replenishment with a few clicks when they are connecting the device to Alexa. Once the device is discovered in the Alexa app, customers can review the consumable that will be reordered, and just need to confirm their address and payment method. Alexa will take care of the supply needs for the device going forward.
Adding inventory reporting in your smart home skill creates an opportunity for you to monetize your connected device by creating a recurring revenue stream. You can choose to sell consumables that you design and manufacture specifically for your device, such as, your branded ink for printers. Alternately, you can choose to receive a fee for other consumables sold on Amazon.com, creating new opportunities for you to grow your business. For example, a thermostat that offers third party air filters could take advantage of this. Developers will earn a one-time referral fee when customers sign up for Dash Replenishment and the first smart reorder is placed. You will also earn revenue for all subsequent smart reorders and manual orders placed through notifications.
 
Easy to Integrate
Amazon provides the customer set up experience in the Alexa app, keeps track of the inventory in the cloud, and automatically reorders supplies. All you need to do is implement inventory reporting using inventory sensors (coming soon) in your smart home skill. Amazon will also work with you to pick the compatible consumable products that will be reordered when your device is running low.
“The implementation of Dash Replenishment was a simple addition to our existing Alexa skill that only required minimal coding from backend engineers” said Justin McConnell, Software Engineer at August Home.
The following diagram shows an overview of the functionality.
Inventory Sensor Options
There are three types of inventory sensors you can choose from to send the consumption data based on the device type and sensor. You can use the Alexa.InventoryLevelSensor later this year in the US and the other two sensor types will be available next year:

You can use the Alexa.InventoryLevelSensor if your device stores the consumable product internally and can report its current status. For example, smart cameras could report the battery level, printers could report the level of ink remaining, etc.
You can use the Alexa.InventoryUsageSensor if your device does not store the consumable product internally, but knows when a given quantity of inventory has been used. For example, coffee machines could report the usage of each pod brewed or amount of ground coffee consumed, a rice cooker could report rice consumption, washing machines and dishwashers can report detergent consumed, etc.
You can use the Alexa.InventoryLevelUsageSensor if your device stores a consumable product internally and can report its usage rather than the current state. You can use it for devices that degrade over time. For example, thermostats could report the fan time to let customers know that it is time to replace the air filter, a vacuum cleaner could alert customers to replace parts such as brushes and dust bags based on how often the vacuum cleaner was used, etc.

Make Your Smart Devices Easy to Setup, Use, and Maintain with Frustration-Free Setup, New Smart Home Skill API Features, and the Alexa Connect Kit;Wed Sep 25 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Nathan Smith;"Today, we’re excited to announce new features you can use to make your smart devices easier for customers to setup, use, and maintain, and easier for you to build.
You can join us in our Frustration-Free Setup initiative, and use simple setup, app-to-app account linking, and automated registration to reduce the number of steps it takes customers to connect your Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and Bluetooth devices to their home network and to Alexa. When you make setting up your products easier, customers can take advantage of them more quickly, with fewer customer service contacts and fewer returns.
You can use the updated Smart Home Skill API and Alexa to enable customers to use more natural voice commands to control any device, to control your home routers and cooking appliances, to stay up-to-date on the state of their smart devices, and even to avoid running out of consumables their devices need to keep running at their best. As a result, you can increase customer engagement and satisfaction with your devices, and create new monetization opportunities for your business.
You can use the Alexa Connect Kit (ACK), to connect any device to the Internet and Alexa without worrying about managing cloud services, Alexa skills, or complex networking and security firmware. With ACK, you can create products that customers love – easily, quickly, and economically.
Finally, we are introducing Certified for Humans, a new program designed to help customers find smart home products that are easy to set up and work seamlessly with Alexa. By meeting the minimum eligibility requirements for the program, you can deliver a better customer experience, and, if your product is certified, you could see increased traffic to your products on Amazon.com through high-visibility placements in search and display the new Certified for Humans badge on your product listings.
 
Make Your Devices Easy to Connect to Customers’ Home Networks and to Alexa
Last year, we announced the Frustration-Free Setup initiative, aimed at making setting up a smart home absolutely simple. We have more work to do together to make it truly effortless. In fact, setup problems are the top source of Amazon customer service contacts and returns for smart home devices.
The first thing a customer does to setup a smart device is connect it to their home network. By reducing the number of steps required to connect your device to the customer’s home network, you can reduce customer frustration, customer service contacts, and product returns. For your business, this means lower cost and higher profit. With simple setup, now generally available for Wi-Fi and Zigbee, and coming soon for Bluetooth, you can enable customers to connect your device to their home networks by simply powering it on in many cases. For example, when a customer purchases your Wi-Fi connected device on Amazon.com and plugs it in, simple setup can securely send the customer’s saved Wi-Fi password to your device, enabling it to join the customer’s Wi-Fi network automatically. Or, the customer can use the Alexa app to scan your device barcode and then follow the simple instructions to complete the setup with fewer steps than before. TP-Link Kasa, Philips Hue, and eero have already implemented simple setup in their products, and you can implement it beginning today.
The second thing many customers do to setup a smart device is to connect it to Alexa. Last month we released app-to-app account linking; you can use it now to enable customers to enable your Alexa skill and link their Alexa account to your account from within your mobile application. We are also working to enable customers to begin controlling a device connected to your Alexa skill before they complete the account linking process. Automated registration, coming soon, can associate a new device with your smart home skill as soon as it is connected, enabling them to use Alexa to control it right away. With the combination of simple setup and automated registration, customers can both connect your device to their network and enable Alexa control simply by plugging it in. TP-Link Kasa is already adding automated registration to their products, and you will be able to add it soon.
You can learn more about Frustration-Free Setup in this blog and request access to the Bluetooth simple setup preview here. Sign up here to be notified when more information on automated registration is available.
 
Deliver More Natural and Complete Control with Smart Home Skill API Updates
The Smart Home Skill API provides building block APIs that you can use to connect any device feature to Alexa, and APIs you can use for the most common smart device functions, such as turning on lights and locking doors. Device makers have used the Smart Home Skill API to integrate more than 85,000 products with Alexa, enabling customers to control them not only with their voices, but also via touch in the Alexa app, and automatically with Routines. We are enhancing both types of APIs to enable you to do more for customers.
Richer Basic Building Block APIs
Last year, we introduced the toggle, mode, and range building block APIs in the US. Lutron, Moen, Dyson, Netgear, Ring, Kenmore and other device makers have used these APIs to enable Alexa control of their air conditioners, air purifiers, dog cameras, fans, humidifiers, routers, vacuums, TVs, and more. Coming soon, you can use the building block APIs in nine additional Alexa locales, specifically Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and the UK. Dyson, eWeLink and Liebherr are already building skills to take advantage. Also coming soon, as described below, you can enable customers to use additional voice commands with the building block APIs, and use the APIs to give customers more details about your device state.
The building block APIs enable you to control any feature of any device using a set of pre-defined phrases. With semantic extensions (coming soon), you can enable additional voice commands - and deliver more natural control - with just a few lines of code. You can tell Alexa to map commands like “open”, “close”, “raise,” and “lower” to specific toggle, range, and mode directives for your device. For example, your customer can say “Alexa, open the garage door,” in addition to “Alexa, set the garage door mode to open.” beam Home and Nexx, are using semantic extensions for their garage door openers, and IKEA, Legrand, Lutron, Schellenberg, and Somfy are using them for their shades. You will be able to use them soon.
Until now, you could use state reporting from your smart home skill to tell Alexa the state of any toggle, mode, or range that customers can control, and Alexa would use this information to keep customers up-to-date by voice and in the Alexa app. With non-controllable states (coming soon), you can also give customers detail on states they cannot control. For example, you can warn customers that the top of your smart stove is too hot to touch, or tell them when your smart washing machine automatically goes from wash to rinse, or rinse to spin. Hamilton Beach uses a non-controllable state to report on the brew cycle status for their smart coffee maker.
You can learn more about the building block API updates in this blog and sign up here to be notified when more information is available.
Inventory State Updates and Easy Re-ordering
One of the states that customers care most about is when consumable products used in your devices, such as air filters, batteries, and coffee pods, get low and need to be replaced. We are excited to announce that coming soon you can use new inventory sensors in the Smart Home Skill API to report the level or usage of consumables used by your device, and take advantage of built-in integration with Alexa and the Dash Replenishment Service to enable automatic re-ordering of consumables when they’re needed. As a result, you can ensure your customers never have that “ran out of it” moment and create new monetization opportunities for your business. You simply provide inventory or usage updates from your smart home skill and identify the right replacement supplies in the Amazon Dash replenishment service portal, and we’ll do the rest. You can choose to sell your own genuine products that you design and manufacture specifically for your device, or you can receive a fee for other products sold on Amazon.com. August Home, Blink, Coway, Ring, Schlage, and Yale are already building skills using inventory sensors, and you can use them soon.
Learn more in this blog and sign up here to be notified when more information is available.
New APIs for Home Networking and Cooking Functions
In addition to the building block APIs, the Smart Home Skill API provides you with APIs designed specifically to enable control of common smart home functions, such as turning on lights, locking doors, and setting target thermostat temperatures. Coming soon, we are introducing a new networking API for controlling home router and Wi-Fi functions, expanding the cooking API to support more cooking modes and functions, and extending 2-way communications with smart home cameras to many more Echo endpoints.
With the new networking API (coming soon), you can enable your customers to use Alexa to control your networking devices. With Alexa control, your customers can use their voices to quickly manage Wi-Fi access and other valuable features in your devices that previously required them to open a mobile app or web browser. You can enable them to manage Wi-Fi access for individual devices or groups of devices. For example, your customers could say, “Alexa, turn off Daniel’s Wi-Fi” when it’s time for dinner and “Alexa, enable guest Wi-Fi” when relatives visit. Arris, ASUS, eero, Linksys, and TP-Link are already building skills using the networking API, and you can use it soon.
The Smart Home Skill API currently supports defrost, preset, reheat, and timecook cooking modes, and is best suited for microwaves and other preset-centric cooking appliances. Coming soon, you can use the updated cooking API to enable customers to control more cooking appliances and functions with Alexa, allowing them to use your appliances hands-free and check cooking progress from other rooms in the house. The updated cooking API enables you to support 40 different cooking modes, including air-fry, bake, pressure cook, roast, and slow cook, and adds new APIs that allow you to enable customer control based on oven and food temperature. GE Appliances, Instant Pot, June Oven, LG, Traeger, and Whirlpool are already building skills using the updated cooking API now, and you can use it soon.
Next year, we will add the ability for you to use Alexa to make announcements on cooking status, and to enable your customers to Scan-to-Cook packaged foods using Alexa. With Scan-to-Cook, your customer can use the Alexa app to scan the barcode on packaged food, and Alexa sends your device the right cooking instructions. Scan-to-Cook will work with hundreds of packaged foods from brands including Whole Foods Market, 365 Everyday Value, Gardein, Marie Callender’s, and more.
Last year, we released the 2-way communication API to enable smart cameras and doorbells to establish 2-way communications with Echo Show and Echo Spot. With this feature, your customers could use these devices to talk to visitors at their door through your smart home camera. Starting tomorrow, your customers can use all Echo devices with a microphone and speaker, including those without screens, to talk to visitors through your smart home camera. If you already support 2-way communications with Echo Show and Echo Spot in your skill, no changes are required to take advantage of this update. If not, you can add 2-way communications using the session controller API.

"Alexa Voice Service now Supports Hindi; US Spanish and Multilingual Mode Coming Soon!";Wed Sep 25 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Ludo Goarin;"Alexa now supports voice interactions in Hindi in addition to other supported languages (click here for the full list). Starting early October, we will support US Spanish and enable Multilingual Mode, which allows Alexa to switch between two languages. Alexa will automatically understand the language from user-spoken utterances and respond in the same language.
Customers in multilingual households are used to naturally switching between languages and Multilingual Mode enables you to do just that - ask for the weather in English, and Alexa will reply in English. If you or someone else in your household asks for the weather in Spanish, Alexa will understand and respond in Spanish. Multilingual Mode will be available in three pairs: English and Spanish in the US, Indian English and Hindi in India, and Canadian English and French in Canada.
To enable Multilingual Mode, we recommend that you use AVS Device SDK 1.15 (or higher), which can be downloaded from GitHub. If you use the AVS SDK 1.15+, support for Multilingual Mode is already built in, and you only need to declare the language pairs. Language pairs are set via the localeCombinations field that has been added to the AlexaClientSDKConfig.json configuration file. See the example below:
If you are planning to continue to use AVS Device SDK 1.14, please use the System 2.0 API to manage settings such as the language locale. The System 2.0 API will allow your device to receive directives, as well as issue events for the purpose of managing common Alexa settings such as the language locale. It is required that you implement the System 2.0 API to support the Dynamic Language Switching feature.
In order to use the System 2.0 API to manage language locales for your device, you must first declare support for this API using the Capabilities API. Here is an excerpt of the Capabilities Request Body that demonstrates how to declare support for US English, US Spanish, IN English and IN Hindi, as well as the supported locale pairs:
Note: the order of locales in localeCombinations matters. The first value determines the primary locale and the second value determines the secondary locale. The WakeWord Model and earcons on the device are determined by the Primary Locale.
System 2.0 is required to support Multilingual Mode, and you will also be required to implement the following new events and directives also included in the System 2.0:

Directives: SetLocales, ReportState
The SetLocales directive is sent by the Alexa service to the AVS device to inform of the updated language settings.
The ReportState directive is sent by the Alexa service to inquire about the state of the device.


Events: LocalesChanged, LocalesReport, StateReport
Your device must send a LocalesChanged event to the Alexa service to update the language settings.
Your device must respond with a LocalesReport event when the language settings have been updated on your device.
Upon receiving the ReportState directive, your device must issue a StateReport event with the information on the locale(s) currently active on the device along with other current settings. See here for more information on ReportState and StateReport.



Here is the flow expected from a language change initiated by the device or companion application:
Here is the flow expected from a language change initiated by voice, in other words by the Alexa Service:
If you are certifying your device for the first time:

Follow the already published checklists for Functional, UX, Acoustic and Music and go through security review.
Tests were added to Functional checklist to check primary and secondary language pair setting using device companion app, voice and multi-modal, which include sanity checks on switching languages on different domains like flash briefing, sports update, weather etc.
There is no additional testing needed for acoustic, music certification and there is no change in security review.

If the device is already certified but being considered for Multilingual Mode incremental feature certification, you will only need additional tests for Functional.
We hope you are as excited as our customers are by the Multilingual Mode feature, and will be implementing this in your device soon.

Use the Alexa Connect Kit, Now Available, to Build Alexa-connected Devices More Easily, Quickly, and Economically;Wed Sep 25 00:00:00 UTC 2019;Ben McInnis;"We are excited to announce that the Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) is now generally available. ACK enables device makers to connect any device to the Internet and Alexa using an Amazon-managed hardware module, without worrying about managing cloud services, Alexa skills, or complex networking and security firmware. We’re also excited to announce multi-step control on ACK devices, coming soon. With multi-step control, you can deliver sophisticated functions like recipe presets from the cloud, allowing you to make your devices smarter and smarter over time, with no firmware updates required. Crock-Pot, Eaton, Hamilton Beach, Leedarson, Midea, Mr. Christmas, Procter & Gamble, Tonly, and Amazon are already using ACK to build products ranging from smart coffee makers to smart Christmas trees. Now, all device makers can order the ACK development kit and begin using ACK to create Alexa-connected products.
Create Products that Customers Love -- Easily, Quickly, and Economically
With ACK, you can make any device a smart device. When you add the Amazon-managed ACK module to your device, your customers get Alexa control by voice and by touch in the Alexa app, Wi-Fi simple setup, and automatic reordering of consumables your product needs to keep running at its best, such as air-filters, batteries, and coffee pods. The ACK module stays up to date automatically with silent, over-the-air firmware updates, and ACK’s managed cloud service meets the cloud reliability requirements of Works with Alexa. In addition, ACK leverages Amazon’s years of experience and infrastructure developing and supporting high-quality consumer devices to deliver:

Implementation Ease. You don’t need to create or manage a cloud service, write an Alexa smart home skill, or develop complex networking and security firmware.
Speed to Market. You prototype using the ACK development kit, integrate into your device using the ACK module and device SDK, and move to volume manufacturing when you’re ready.
Cost Certainty. ACK enables more certain business planning with a low per-device fee - less than $7 per device on average - that covers both the hardware module and ongoing use of the ACK cloud service. As a result, you don’t need to worry about unpredictable cloud infrastructure and usage costs.

Since we launched Alexa Connect Kit in preview last year, dozens of leading device makers and consumer products companies have used it to build Alexa-connected products, including:

The Hamilton Beach Smart 12-Cup Coffee Maker, available for pre-order today.
The Mr. Christmas Smart Christmas Tree, available for pre-order today.
The Amazon Smart Oven, available for pre-order today, and the AmazonBasics Microwave, already available.
The Crock-Pot Alexa-enabled slow cooker, coming soon.

""Using Alexa Connect Kit, we were able to take our first Alexa connected product from idea to mass manufacturing in less than 6 weeks. ACK enabled us to deliver on a magical experience for our customers that we previously never thought possible,"" said Leslie Hermanson, President, Mr. Christmas.
“The Alexa-enabled Crock-Pot Slow Cooker is the next innovation in Crock-Pot’s line of slow cookers that make it easier for consumers to spend less time cooking and more time doing things they love. We’re thrilled to work with Amazon to further bring our vision for connected products to life,” said David Hammer, Division CEO, Appliances & Cookware, Newell Brands, maker of Crock-Pot slow cookers.
""Eaton is excited to be using the Alexa Connect Kit to accelerate development of our connected products and provide a great experience for our customers. As we continue to develop connected solutions, Eaton looks forward to working with Amazon to deliver products and services that improve the way we live, work, and play,” said Mike Yelton, President of Eaton’s Commercial & Residential Distribution Solutions Business.
How Alexa Connect Kit Works
When a customer says “Alexa, turn on the lights,” Alexa will send a “turn on the light” message to the Alexa Connect Kit service in the cloud. The service will forward this message to your device on the customer’s home Wi-Fi network. The ACK module on your device receives the message from Alexa and sends it to your device’s host microcontroller (HMCU) via serial bus. You use the ACK device SDK to update your HMCU code to act on the message.
You define which capabilities from the Smart Home Skill API your device supports in the ACK console. You can take advantage of APIs designed for common smart home functions, such as turning on lights, and toggle, mode, and range building block APIs that you can use for any device function. In addition to receiving and responding to control directives from Alexa, the ACK module and ACK cloud services provide support for simple setup, the Amazon Dash Replenishment Service, and the device metrics, logs, and over-the-air update capabilities to manage your devices in the field.
Building with the Alexa Connect Kit
The ACK developer tools, available today, allow you to prototype smart devices, update your HMCU firmware to handle ACK messages, and integrate the ACK module into your hardware.
You can purchase the ACK Development Kit today on Amazon.com. The development kit includes a USI development board with integrated ACK module, an Arduino Zero development board, and an LED used for prototyping a smart light device. You can follow step-by-step instructions in our documentation to build an Alexa-controlled smart light with ACK. You can use source code from the ACK device SDK to update your HMCU code, and the ACK console to configure your device’s Alexa command and control experience.
In addition, coming soon, you can use ACK multi-step control to deliver sophisticated functions like recipe presets from the cloud. You provide the logic which dictates which primitive commands to send to your device and when, based on time, device state, and more. Your device provides real-time state information and responds to primitive commands. The ACK cloud does the rest, including sending the right commands at the right time. Multi-step control (coming soon) allows you to make your devices smarter and smarter over time, with no firmware updates required.

Deep Dive: How to Build an Alexa-Connected Musical Keyboard with the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit;Wed Sep 11 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Nitin Arora;"In August, we released Custom Interfaces, the newest feature available in the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit. Custom Interfaces enable you to connect gadgets, games, and smart toy products with immersive skill-based content—unlocking creative ways for customers to experience your product. Using the Custom Interface Controller, you can design voice experiences that are tailored to your product’s unique functionality.

Want to start building with Custom Interfaces, but don’t know where to start? To demonstrate the process for building a prototype, we created our own Alexa-connected musical keyboard using the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit. Alexa lights up a sequence of keys on the keyboard corresponding to a given song. When user plays that sequence back, Alexa provides feedback on whether the user pressed right sequence of keys or not. Here’s a video of the experience:
The prototype for this musical keyboard uses the Color Cycler sample provided in the Alexa Gadgets Raspberry Pi Samples Github repository, and builds upon the sample to enable new and unique functionality to teach people how to play different songs.
 
The Hardware
The Color Cycler sample uses a single RGB LED and a simple button for the hardware, and uses an Alexa skill to respond to a button press before the experience ends. For the keyboard experience, we needed multiple LEDs to indicate what keys should be pressed, and multiple buttons – a single button for each key. Once the new hardware has been added, it looked something like this without the keyboard overlay:
As you can see, each LED is aligned to its corresponding button used for each key. With the updated hardware in place, the keyboard can light up when a customer chooses a song from within the skill.
 
Illuminating Keys in a Sequence
With the hardware assembled, LEDs can be illuminated to teach the customer which keys to press to play the song. When the skill starts, the Enumeration API is used to verify there is a gadget paired to the Echo device. If so, the customer can select a song they want to learn to play. Based on the chosen song, a Custom Directive is sent to the paired Alexa Gadget via a Custom Interface that has been defined. The JSON sent from the skill looks like this:
{
""type"":""CustomInterfaceController.SendDirective"",
""header"":
{
""name"": ""ledSequencer"",
""namespace"": ""custom.PianoMessaging""
},
""endpoint"": {
""endpointId"": ""...""
},
""payload"":
{
""gapTime"": 500,
""sequence"": '112143',
""init_delay"": 1000
}
}
The payload specifies which notes should be played, the time between each note, and a delay that controls when the sequence should start playing. On the gadget side, the payload is parsed and used to illuminate the LEDs in accordance to the song that was chosen.
 
Hitting the Right Notes
Illuminating the keys to indicate which notes should be hit is only half of the experience. In order to learn the song, the customer must press the keys in the correct order – otherwise, Alexa will adapt the experience accordingly. Using the Custom Interface we defined previously, events from the Alexa Gadget can be sent to the skill, giving Alexa the opportunity to respond and customize the experience.

On the gadget side, two types of events are sent to the skill: an event that lets the skill know that the LED sequence has stopped playing and the skill should start listening to key presses, and an event that is sent to the skill on each key press. The event for the individual key press looks like this:
{
""header"": {
""namespace"": ""Custom.PianoMessaging"",
""name"": ""keyStroke""
},
""payload"": {
""keystroke"": ""1""
}
}
As each key press is sent to the skill, the sequence can be compared to the master sequence stored as a session attribute within the skill. If the customer presses all the right keys, it should match the session attribute, and they can continue through the skill. If they make a mistake, the sequence will not match what’s in the session attribute, and Alexa can jump in to help.

Introducing Custom Interfaces, Enabling Developers to Build Dynamic Gadgets, Games, and Smart Toys with Alexa;Thu Aug 15 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Karen Yue;"Since launching Alexa more than four years ago, customers have purchased more than 100 million Alexa-enabled devices, allowing them to interact with products in new and engaging ways. Today, we are excited to introduce new developer tools that enable you to connect gadgets, games, and smart toy products with immersive skill-based content—unlocking creative ways for customers to experience your product. This is made possible using Custom Interfaces, the newest feature available in the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit.
 
Explore the Fun Side of Alexa: Gadgets, Games, and Smart Toys
Gadgets, games, and smart toys come in all shapes and sizes, and for all ages. With Custom Interfaces, you can design dynamic interactions with Alexa that span multiple product categories from board games and action figures, to gizmos and novelties. For example, a basketball hoop for your office that lights up the scoreboard when you say “Alexa, tell Basketball Hoop to start a game,” and triggers Alexa’s response when you score.
A mini keyboard that turns Alexa into a piano teacher, lighting up keys that correspond to a given song and providing feedback on whether you have pressed the right sequence of keys.
An indoor drone that flies when you say “Alexa, tell my drone to fly in a figure 8,” and triggers Alexa to play a tune upon landing.
A game printer that creates a game sheet when you say, “Alexa, tell Game Printer to give me a Sudoku puzzle.""
A dog toy that counts how many times your dog plays fetch, and lights up green when a 20-minute session has concluded.
 

The Benefits of Custom Interfaces
With Custom Interfaces, you can build products that can be updated with new functionality and refreshed content to enhance the overall interactive experience. You can also offer premium product features that can be unlocked through in-skill purchasing. Custom Interfaces support the following:

Direct Communication: Facilitate connection and communication between your product and Alexa, removing the burden of creating a device cloud and customer account management infrastructure.
Dynamic Voice Interactions: Design robust voice interactions for your product, to create extended, story-driven experiences for your customers.
Adapts to Your Product: Get support for a wide range of capabilities, regardless of what you are trying to build.
To unlock these features, and enable Alexa to interact with the unique capabilities of your product, you will need to create a compatible Alexa skill. The custom interaction is achieved through the Custom Interface Controller, a skill API that exchanges messages with your product over the course of a given skill session, allowing you to design voice experiences that are tailored to your product’s functionality.
Messages sent from your skill to your product, or directives, can be configured to activate a range of reactions from your product through motors, sound chips, lights, and more. You can trigger directives in response to game behavior, alongside specific moments in storytelling, or in its simplest form, in response to an explicit command from your customers.
Messages sent from your product to a skill, or events, can be triggered by customers engaging directly with your product whether by activating a button, triggering an accelerometer, or achieving a specific sequence of events. Events can also be triggered by the state of your product. When the skill is in session, you will need to ensure that there is an active input handler to listen for an event. You can determine how long to listen for an event — up to 90 seconds — and filter the specific events that you want your skill to receive.
 
Build for Younger Audiences (Now in Private Beta)
With the help of Custom Interfaces, we are unlocking additional opportunities for developers to create playful, educational and interactive gadgets, games, and smart toys for younger audiences. From kids role play and action figures to building and learning smart toys, you can create unique story-rich interactions with characters that kids already know and love. For example, a teddy bear that reacts to an audio story provided through a companion Alexa kid skill.
All products targeted to kids under the age of 13 must have an accompanying kid skill. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we require permission from a parent before kid skills can be used.
Our Private Beta is limited to commercial developers by invite only.
 
Get Started with Custom Interfaces
To help you get started on your first prototype using Custom Interfaces, we are excited to share sample projects that enable you to build with Raspberry Pi and Python-based software. The software includes sample applications and step-by-step guides that simplify the process of getting your prototype connected and plugged in to the capabilities of Alexa Gadgets Toolkit.

Announcing Expanded Alexa Mobile Accessory Features and Solutions for On-the-Go Experiences;Sat Jul 27 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Sanjay Ramaswamy;"We are excited to announce expanded features and solutions that enable device makers to bring Alexa experiences to headphones, earbuds, headsets, and other Bluetooth devices. Last year, we announced the general availability of the Alexa Mobile Accessory (AMA) Kit, enabling device makers to build Alexa into Bluetooth accessories that connect to Android and iOS devices by seamlessly pairing with the Amazon Alexa App. At the time, we also announced the availability of a reference design from Qualcomm and several systems integrators solutions. Today, we are announcing new AMA features, including location-aware responses, access to more music services, and new solutions including a new development kit from Knowles, and two new turnkey headphone and earbud solutions from My Music Group, making it even easier for device makers to provide delightful on-the-go experiences.
With Alexa built-in devices that implement the AMA protocol, users have been able to ask Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, manage calendars, get weather updates, and access tens of thousands of Alexa skills. We are constantly evolving what AMA can do and are excited to announce the following new features we have added since launch: 1) GPS-based location support, which allows users to ask Alexa for directions and traffic updates using Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps – or for local weather information, movie times, and searches, and 2) access to a growing selection of media services, including Amazon Music, Pandora*, Audible, Kindle, Sirius XM, Music Skills Kit for Live Streaming, and Gimme Radio, with more still to come. Lastly, wake-word engines from Amazon, Retune and others now allow device makers to provide completely hands-free Alexa experiences for headphones and earbuds.
Sony first implemented the AMA protocol via an over-the-air firmware update in January of this year for their popular Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones models WH-1000XM3, WH-1000XM2, and WI-1000X, to bring Alexa experiences anywhere with a simple touch on the ear cup. They followed this up with four more models in April: WF-1000X, WH-XB700, and WH-CH700N. Earlier this month, they updated four more models in their headphones and earbuds portfolio (WH-H900N, WF-SP700N, WI-SP600N, and WI-C600N) to bring Alexa experiences to more customers.
“With a simple integration, AMA has provided rich, on-the-go Alexa features that enable engaging customer experiences,” said Yang Cheng, Head of Video & Sound Business at Sony Electronics Inc. “Our customers love that they can easily access music, get information on-the-go, make calls, and control smart home devices with voice. Along with industry leading noise canceling and smart listening controls, we are thrilled to bring innovative voice experiences to our customers. We look forward to continually delighting our users with voice access to more music services, location-aware features, timers, and more.”
We are continually enabling multiple options for device makers to leverage AMA for existing or new headphones, earbuds, and headsets. We are delighted to announce the following additions to our portfolio.
The Knowles AISonic SmartMic Headset Development Kit for Amazon AVS is a production-ready implementation of AMA, and is the first Amazon-qualified development kit for hearables with voice-initiated Alexa functionality.

Introducing Announcements on Alexa Built-in Devices;Fri May 24 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Ford Davidson;"Today, Alexa Voice Service (AVS) is making Announcements available for certified Alexa built-in products to implement and new ones that pass the provided self-tests and certification. Alexa Announcements enables customers to make and receive one-way announcements to and from compatible Alexa built-in devices in their household. Similar to a one-way intercom, Alexa Announcements is great for quick, broad communications you want to share with your whole family. This allows customers to announce on their device from the kitchen that “dinner is ready,” or that “it’s time to wake up,” or from their Fire TV Cube that “the movie is starting.” This audio message will be “announced” playing back simultaneously through the other Alexa built-in devices in the home. Customers can also use the Alexa app when they are away from home to make an Announcement.
Amazon will continuously improve the Announcement feature to create better customer experiences and to ensure consistency across all Alexa built-in devices.
If you already have a product in market, you can find documentation to enable Announcements on your device here. If you are developing a new product, Announcements will be possible to add as part of your AVS implementation and AVS certification will cover testing of this feature.

How to Leverage Presets with Alexa Cooking APIs;Tue May 21 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Ahmed El Araby;"Even as Amazon Alexa now appears on over 30,000 Alexa-compatible smart home devices, Alexa is also helping families to do more in the kitchen. With new innovative microwave products, Alexa can control the appliance from anywhere in the house with simple voice commands. This new functionality is available in an expanded Alexa Smart Home Skill API and helps customers prepare meals by replacing cooking controls like defrost, popcorn mode, time and power that would normally require 5 to 10 button presses with a simple voice command. Additionally, the hands-free ability for a consumer to pause and resume cooking in an oven while they take a call or handle another event is exceptionally useful.
In 2018, Amazon released its first voice-controlled microwave, and GE followed suit. Both microwaves utilize the Alexa voice capabilities. These microwaves provide consumers with easy-to-remember voice commands to prepare common food items like popcorn and frozen pizza.
If your business offers a connected microwave, this blog post will help you create an easy-to-consume food preset catalog that you can associate with your microwave Alexa skill.
 
The Cooking Interface
To understand how to implement commands for cooking, we will share the steps and best practices to add voice support to cooking devices. As developers integrate cooking-centered voice commands into connected microwaves, one of the first challenges for providing a great user experience is that packaged food items have complicated names. Variations on sub-brands, sizes, and flavors all lead to requiring voice commands that might be challenging for the customer and Alexa. To help simplify and standardize this interface for developers, Alexa defines the Alexa.Cooking Interface. This interface is common to all cooking endpoints and describes the available operations for the device.
The basic voice operation of a microwave would be something like “Alexa, two minutes on my microwave.” This command assumes that customer already placed a food item inside the microwave, and that the customer knows the cooking time required. In case the customer didn’t specify the time, Alexa would ask about the time required to cook the item.
What if customers didn’t know the correct mode and the right amount of time to cook and item? In this case, the Alexa preset cooking comes handy. If the microwave manufacturer has created a preset catalog, cusotmers can only ask Alexa to cook by preset name, without the need to know the mode of the time required. In some cases, preset cooking requires either weight, volume or quantity (count) to perfectly cook the food item. This is determined by the preset catalog author. The author can specify that one or more of these food properties are required to fulfill the request. If it is required, Alexa will ask the customer about count, volume or weight if customer didn’t specify them in the request.
For cooking with preset settings, the Alexa.Cooking.PresetController helps developers define custom cooking settings appropriate for a manufacturer's appliance.
 
Using a Preset Catalog
If a microwave has an often used or common preset, the developer should consider it to be controlled with voice commands. Specifically, Alexa-enabled microwaves can provide customers with the ability to cook with most of the commonly used recipes and packaged food by simply providing the name of the food. (The food name will be resolved to a slot value, or catalog item, and will be sent to you skill within the Alexia directive.) Using voice means fewer buttons for the customer to press and convenient cooking control while their hands are busy or messy. Beyond stopping and starting cooking, adjustments to power levels and duration are also available. For example, a customer can stop cooking and then instruct Alexa to set the microwave at 80% power for three minutes.
To understand how a preset is used for a cooking device, let’s look at an example. To support a preset for ""PRIMO Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice,” the flow from configuration to handling a PresetController directive from Alexa looks like the following:
The developer provides Amazon with a Preset Catalog of supported, custom cooking settings. This includes an entry for “PRIMO Mango Chicken with Coconut Rice.”
After the catalog is ingested by Amazon, the developer will receive a unique preset catalog ID to be used in the discovery response of a cooking device.
The developer builds an Alexa skill that supports the cooking endpoint.
The discovery response returned by the cooking endpoint skill defines the required presetCatalogId (received from catalog ingestion) and supportedCookingModes.
A customer enables the cooking endpoint skill through account linking.
The customer says, “Alexa, microwave the Primo mango chicken with coconut rice.”
Alexa interprets the food and cooking verb from the customer and sends a CookByPreset directive to the cooking endpoint skill.
Using the preset directive information, the cooking endpoint instructs the endpoint to cook on High for two minutes.

To provide cooking by name of an item, it is necessary for Amazon to train Alexa to understand the items in a provided preset catalog to offer the best customer experience.
 
Using the Supported Cooking Modes
A required element of a cooking endpoint is the Supported Cooking Modes. These modes describe the configuration settings for a defined mode.
The current CookingMode values are as follows:

Defrost - Cooking appliance is automatically configured to defrost mode
Off - Switches off the device
Preset - Brings it back to its automated cooking
Reheat - Sets it to reheating mode
TimeCook - Sets the time and power level for cooking

For example, an endpoint with the Defrost cooking mode defined could support the following user utterance: ""Alexa, defrost two pounds of chicken.” In this example, the Preset is a chicken, while the Cooking Mode will be set to DEFROST. Alexa has support for food quantities, count or weight when using the preset cooking functionality.
 
Best Practices for Authoring the Preset Catalog
For most customers, it can be tedious when mentioning the full name of the item they want to cook in the microwave. For instance, having to say, “Alexa, microwave PRIMO Frozen Sandwiches Four Meat and Four Cheese Pizza” and “Alexa, cook ALWAYS-FRESH Frozen Sandwiches Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza.” Those two items have the same cooking instructions, and customers end up omitting the brand name. This omission might lead to preset name failure.
To overcome this problem, avoid repeating the same words in more than one item; this makes detection more difficult. Understanding that only the Preset Name and Cooking Mode are required, it is recommended to group similar items by the mode of cooking and not the item name. For example, the following two items share the same cooking mode and time settings, as well as the general item name, but are from different brands:
In this scenarios, group these two items into one preset record: HERB ROASTED CHICKEN.Users can say, “Alexa, cook Herb Roasted Chicken” or “Alexa, Microwave Herb Roasted Chicken.” In this case, there is a preset on this microwave for Herb Roasted Chicken. Alexa sends a Cook By Preset directive with details about the food.
 
Conclusion
Developers should understand the challenges of voice recognition when undertaking Preset Cooking and should expect that Preset Catalog Item names reflect the most common way people identify or describe the cooked item. This is not necessarily the actual name on the box label. You should research how your customer names or refers to the supported food items that are to be used by your endpoint. Additionally, focus on how an item is cooked using your device and not the preset name.

Best Practices for Building Alexa Smart Home Camera Skills;Tue May 07 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Anna Khabibullina;"Low latency is a key contributor to customer satisfaction with smart home camera skills.  Customers who connect their smart home cameras and doorbells to Alexa love streaming live camera feeds to Echo Show and Echo Spot, but can be frustrated if the stream takes a long time to appear. If it takes too long for the stream to appear, customers may stop using the feature, provide a negative review or low star ratings on the skill, or both. This blog describes 10 tips to help you optimize the AWS Lambda function and related services for your smart home camera skill.
Background
The diagram below demonstrates the current interaction model between Alexa and developer services.
Optimization Best Practices
To improve performance of the Lambda function for your Alexa smart home skill, you can take the following steps:

Adjust Skill Lambda function memory allocation: allocating more memory (MB) will provide more CPU power to your function and will execute it faster. This can result in positive customer experience with faster response times and lower running cost by reducing the execution time for Lambda function.
Adjust Skill Lambda timeout to 6 seconds: increase the Lambda timeout from the default of 3 to 6 seconds. You must send a response to Alexa within 6 sec but to ensure better CX, we recommend to optimize the time to get it out as soon as you can:
For RTSP path, all responses must occur 6 seconds or less after request received.
For WebRTC path, for any offer sent to your skill, you must respond with the answer within 6 seconds.


Decouple init, config and core logic: any externalized configuration or dependencies that your code retrieves should be stored and referenced locally after initial execution. This will limit re-initialization of variables/objects on every invocation.
Cold start / runtime optimizations: if your Lambda function is not invoked for some time, it is removed from the underlying container. When you try to access it for the first time after this idle period, it loads it again and that takes some extra time in loading all the required code and initializing it. One of the benefits with using Node.js and Python over Java to write Lambda functions is that they produce much smaller packages — which we know translates to lower code start time.
Minimize the complexity of your dependencies: prefer simpler frameworks that load quickly on Execution Context startup. For example, if you use Java, prefer simple dependency injection (IoC) frameworks like Dagger or Guice, over more complex ones like Spring Framework and consider removing unused/dead code. By deleting Lambda functions you no longer need, the unused functions won't needlessly count against deployment package size limit. This will reduce the amount of time that it takes for your deployment package to be downloaded and unpacked ahead of invocation.
Core logic optimizations: once the directive is received, parallelize as many event-processing tasks because many of them are i/o bound and by parallelizing them you can get performance better. Check if any logic (other than the critical path) is executing in the Lambda. For RTSP path, we recommend to return the URI (RTSP) or the answer (WebRTC) at the earliest possible opportunity before continuing with any further processing. Specifically, operations like returning of the URI and waking a camera to begin streaming should be done asynchronously as background. This technique will improve a user’s perceived performance. You can send out interstitial video frames until the camera stream is actually available such as LoopUntilLive feature from Wowza.
Regionalization: do not do any cross-region calls. We recommend placement of Lambda functions and media services in additional regions based on geographic distances contributing to latency and regions supported by Alexa Service. At the very minimum, if you serve in NA & EU, your AWS should support 3 regions: N. Virginia (us-east-1), Dublin (eu-west-1), Oregon (us-west-2). The list of all supported regions for Lambda can be found on AWS website.

Lambda Latency Optimization Recommendations
Additionally, having the following metrics, dashboards and alarms will help you proactively make sure customers have a great experience, with the added benefit of meeting one of the eligibility standards of the Works with Alexa (WWA) program:

Setup CloudWatch monitoring and alerts for your Lambda & media server (if non-existent today) to automatically notify your dev team about anomalous activity when critical incidents happened (e.g. customer-impacting issue such as outage or severe regression which may require interaction with Alexa team and/or fixes on developer side). At the very minimum, we suggest to setup alarms for the following rules / thresholds: min & max thresholds:
Lambda Volume and TPS (P50, P90) per region and camera device model
Lambda response latency (P50, P90) per region and camera device model
Lambda success rate (P50, P90) i.e. successful response rate, per region and camera device model
Lambda failure rate (P50, P90) i.e. invocation error, by error type, per region and camera device model
Stream responsiveness duration (P50, P90) per region and camera device model.
For RTSP path, this can be measured as URI responsiveness time is the duration between the time when the skill Lambda sent media URI to Alexa Service and the first time rendering device attempts to play it.
For WebRTC path, this can be measured as URI responsiveness time is the duration between the time when the partner Lambda sent AnswerGeneratedForSessionEvent to Alexa Service and the first time the camera/doorbell device started the stream.




Prepare the quality / operational reports on regular cadence (recommended: weekly or bi-weekly) you will review internally as part of your weekly meetings. You can use AWS X-Ray to show for debugging / troubleshooting and generating reports with latency improvements for your AWS services. You can also enable X-Ray in Prod system and sample X% of traffic to get visibility into common issues. During each skill launch, check your operational dashboards to verify no unusual activity (such as spikes or drops for the traffic volume or success / failure rates) occurred. If you found the missing metrics / dashboards / alarms, account time to add it. Avoid deploying changes to Lambda before a weekend or other periods of time where engineers will not be around to address issues.
Run load / performance tests for your Lambda functions to determine the optimum memory size configuration. We also recommend auditing your hardware and bandwidth connectivity for reliability

4 Tips for Implementing Device Discovery in Your Smart Home Skills;Fri Apr 19 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Roy Kincaid;"Building an Alexa smart home skill enables you to link Alexa with your existing smart home device cloud. This gives your customers the ability to control and query their compatible devices through Alexa. When creating a smart home skill, one of the first steps is to implement the Alexa.Discovery interface.The Device Discovery process allows you to send Alexa a list of your customer’s devices and capabilities, so that they can interact with them through voice or the Alexa app.
When testing your implementation of the Alexa.Discovery interface, you first need to check that you've enabled the skill on your Alexa account and successfully performed account linking. The next step is to run device discovery from your Alexa account. If no endpoints are found from your skill, then you may have encountered a device discovery error. Here are four common culprits you can look into to resolve these errors.
 
1. Consider the Location of Your Customers, Your AWS Lambda Functions, and Supported Languages
In order for your customers to successfully discover devices in their Alexa accounts, the following three regional factors will need to align:
Languages Available on the Skill
When creating a smart home skill, like other skill types, you first choose the default language. Additional languages can be added to the skill, later.
Regions the Skill’s AWS Lambda Functions Are Deployed To
For each language that you add to the skill, you will need to ensure that you have an AWS Lambda Function deployed to the corresponding region. For a full list of these mappings, please see the table in the following tech doc: Deploy Your Lambda Function to Multiple Regions.
Region of the Customer’s Amazon Account
Amazon accounts are associated with a particular region that determines the skills that are available within the Alexa Skills Store. For example, if an Amazon account is of the US region, then the skills available from the Alexa Skills Store for that account will be those with an English (US) locale.
Avoiding Availability Issues When Testing
When testing the development version of your smart home skill, you will need to take note of the region of the Amazon account that you are testing with, as this can determine whether or not device discovery will be successful. Please note: When developing a skill, the development version will be available for testing on your corresponding Amazon account, regardless of the languages of the model.
If your Amazon account’s region is different from what your skill’s current configuration supports, then the Device Discovery request will not make it to your skill’s Lambda function. In this case, the skill’s Lambda function would not have received the discovery request, thus no corresponding request log will be found in Amazon CloudWatch. This will not be an issue once the skill is live in the Alexa Skills Store, as it will only be available to Amazon accounts that are set to the corresponding region.
CloudWatch Logs Tip: Availability issues = no discover request logged
 
2. Check the Latency of Your Skill’s Lambda Function, and Related Async Calls
Once your skill’s Lambda function has received a device discovery request, the skill has a maximum of 8 seconds with which to return a response. However, we recommended that responses are sent as quickly as possible.
When first creating a Lambda function, the default timeout is set to 3 seconds. Updating this timeout to 7 seconds will help avoid the potential for the lambda function to time out before returning the final Discover.Response within Alexa's timeout window. If you are planning on building a smart home camera skill, then please note that they have a timeout window of 6 seconds. Please see the Build Smart Home Camera Skills documentation for additional information. For changing the default timeout of a Lambda function, please take a look at Basic AWS Lambda Function Configuration.
CloudWatch Logs Tip: Lambda Timeout Issues = discover request logged, 'task timed out' Message Logged
Another common culprit of timeout issues are any asynchronous calls being made within your skill code. Is your device cloud taking too long to return a response to your skill's Lambda function? Logging any asynchronous requests and responses made within your skill’s Lambda function is very important in helping to pinpoint the source of the latency.
 
3. Ensure That Your Skill Is Not Returning Malformed JSON
Another common issue regarding device discovery failures is malformed Discover.Response JSON. The first step in troubleshooting this is to copy the complete JSON response that your skill returned from your Amazon CloudWatch logs and check it with a JSON validator to ensure that it is valid.
If valid JSON was returned, the next step would be to compare it with a known working sample. A general Discover.Response sample that includes various types of endpoints can be found in the Alexa smart home Github, here.
For more specific examples, please see the device templates in our Get Started with Device Templates documentation.
CloudWatch Logs Tip: Malformed JSON Response = discover request and return response both logged.
 
4. Check Access Token Refresh Requests From Your Authorization Server
If you've successfully completed device discovery, and then notice that later discover requests are failing, the culprit could be that the Alexa service could not successfully refresh and retrieve a valid access token from the skill's authorization service. You can check the logs of your authorization service to ensure that refresh requests are successfully completing.
CloudWatch Logs Tip: Apparent when first discovery flow after account linking completes successfully, and subsequent device discovery requests are not logged.

Introducing Product Access Control for the AVS Developer Portal;Wed Mar 13 07:00:00 UTC 2019;Vinay Athma;"On 8-March-2019, Alexa Voice Service (AVS) launched a new capability in the AVS Developer Portal called Product Access Control. This capability enables portal users with the Administrator role to manage which AVS products the users in their account can access.
Product Access Control is useful for two core reasons:

Working with External Entities: If your company works closely with external entities such as AVS System Integrators (SIs) or Original Device Manufacturers (ODMs), Product Access Control allows you to invite and grant access to users for specific AVS products in your developer account. This makes it easy for external parties to collaborate with your company on a specific product without being able to see or access other AVS devices in your account.
Maintaining Product Secrecy: If your developer account has an AVS product that you do not want accessible by others in your company (e.g. a secret project), Product Access Control allows you to restrict who has access to that product.

Product Access Control can be accessed within “AVS Developer Portal > My Preferences > Users & Access.” Please note that this capability is available only to users who have an Administrator role in your developer account.

Mesh Wi-Fi Systems with Alexa Built-in: Redefining How Users Interact with their Wireless Network;Wed Feb 20 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Dileepan Narayanan;"Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. today announced the launch of the Qualcomm Mesh Networking Development Kit for Amazon Alexa Voice Service (AVS). This development kit accelerates the integration of AVS into mesh Wi-Fi systems.
The Wi-Fi router in the home has held an important and evolving role in enabling connected devices and experiences. As Wi-Fi technology faces the explosive increase of video consumption and connected devices, ensuring corner-to-corner Radio Frequency (RF) coverage in homes with brick or cinder block walls is a challenge. Data and RF requirements have resulted in the Wi-Fi router moving to more central locations within the home by the consumer, many of whom are leveraging Alexa’s ability to play the role of central communicator in the smart home ecosystem. These factors have also resulted in the standalone Wi-Fi router evolving into mesh Wi-Fi systems. Collectively, these changes make the residential Wi-Fi network a natural new home for Alexa.
The Qualcomm Mesh Networking Development Kit for Amazon AVS is the first ever Amazon-qualified reference design for a mesh Wi-Fi system with Alexa built-in. This reference platform is based on the Qualcomm IPQ4019 SoC and includes a rectangular 4-microphone array, far-field audio processing algorithms for noise suppression, acoustic echo cancellation, wake word engine, and the AVS Device SDK, to provide far-field voice recognition capability. It simplifies product engineering and reduces development time for OEMs looking to build Alexa into mesh routers.
“Qualcomm’s development kit enables device makers to build voice-first mesh Wi-Fi systems with minimal time and financial investment,” said Priya Abani, Director of the Alexa Voice Service. “We’re thrilled that Qualcomm continues to provide solutions that make it even easier for companies to bring Alexa built-in products to their customers.” 
Here are a few ways users can interact with Alexa on their mesh Wi-Fi systems:
The Qualcomm Mesh Networking Dev Kit for Amazon AVS brings a host of benefits to consumers. First, with Alexa integrated in a mesh system, whole home deployment of Alexa is a simpler decision. Second, with Alexa leveraging the mesh system’s local processing and connectivity, the need for separate standalone Alexa built-in devices in the home is reduced. Third, Alexa’s integration into the home Wi-Fi infrastructure ensures more seamless control of all devices throughout the home via voice.
With the Qualcomm Mesh Networking Dev Kit for Amazon AVS, it is now simpler and quicker than ever to create next-generation voice-enabled connected experiences in the home.

Works with Alexa Certification Helps Wyze Labs Sell 1 Million Smart Cameras in Only 12 Months;Thu Feb 07 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Brian Crum;"When four former Amazonians founded Wyze Labs in July 2017, they were on a mission: to challenge the notion that full-featured, easy-to-use, smart home cameras had to be expensive. Only one year after introducing the first generation Wyze Cam, they’ve introduced new cameras, new features, added Alexa connectivity, and achieved Works with Alexa (WWA) certification - helping them to achieve their goal of selling 1 million devices in its first year.
“In October, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Wyze Cam and a major milestone in our business,” says Elana Fishman, co-founder and chief operating officer of Wyze Labs. “Thanks to having a reliable product, a great customer experience, and the Works with Alexa badge, we’re thrilled to have sold a million cameras in only 12 months.”
Sharing Amazon’s obsession with providing premium customer experiences, Wyze’s leadership team immediately recognized the growth opportunities offered by the Works with Alexa program. Works with Alexa is a certification program that helps assure customers the products they buy will integrate smoothly with Alexa. WWA-certified devices can carry the Works with Alexa badge, appear in the Amazon Smart Home store, and can be considered for additional co-marketing opportunities. For Wyze, adding Alexa support gave existing Wyze customers the Alexa integration they wanted, and becoming WWA certified increased customer awareness and confidence in the Wyze brand.
“Even though we exceed our customers’ expectations, buyers are often skeptical they can actually get such a high-quality camera at our competitive price tag,” says Fishman. “The Works with Alexa badge helped change that. It adds an extra stamp of quality to our products, so shoppers are confident in selecting our cameras over non-certified devices.”
 
What Customers Want: An Affordable High-Quality Smart Camera -with Alexa Integration
Wyze set out to build a high-quality smart home security camera that anyone could afford. Only three months after setting up shop, they launched the first Wyze Cam and quickly sold out in their first quarter of sales. But even after such a successful launch, Wyze wanted to improve its cameras and the user experience.
“Having used Amazon Launchpad to build our first major sales channel, we asked customers which integrations they wanted, directly on our Amazon.com product page,” says Fishman. “And the top customer request, again and again, was Alexa.”
Wyze decided to give customers what they wanted: the ability to view their Wyze Cam live stream video via Alexa. To do that, they needed to create an Alexa smart home skill. Wyze re-architected some of its communication mechanisms to integrate with Alexa. The Wyze Cam uses a peer-to-peer connection to stream video to the mobile app, instead of the cloud model used with Alexa smart home skills. The Wyze team made the investment of time and resources to make the Wyze Cam compatible with Alexa because they knew it was important to customers.
No longer limited to a smartphone app, Wyze customers can now use natural voice commands to view their camera video feeds on more devices than ever, including Alexa-enabled devices with screens like Echo Show, Echo Spot, and Fire TVs.
 
Works with Alexa: A Boost to the Business to Reach 1 Million Units Sold
Works with Alexa certification communicates to customers that your products integrate seamlessly with Alexa, with the WWA badge added to your products in both the Alexa Smart Home Store and offline channels.  For Wyze, WWA certification came just in time for Prime Day 2018, allowing them to use the WWA badge during this significant sales opportunity And Wyze isn’t alone in seeing a sales uplift after achieving WWA certification. In fact, sales analysis across the entire Amazon Smart Home store shows a double-digit sales uplift after achieving WWA certification for the 8 weeks post-certification compared to the 8 weeks pre-certification.
“What our customers asked for was to use our cameras with Alexa, and it was an awesome thing to deliver on that,” says Fishman. “But from the business side, WWA has opened up a lot of lucrative marketing opportunities not otherwise available to us.” With the WWA badge, Fishman says the Wyze Cam started “showing up all over Amazon.com” with other Alexa-compatible smart devices, immediately increasing its visibility. Wyze was also able to create promotional bundles of its cameras with Echo Show and Echo Spot, right in time for the holidays. And, as if heightened online visibility wasn’t enough, Amazon invited Wyze to feature its cameras in Amazon’s physical retail locations, including Amazon 4-Star, Amazon Books, and Amazon Pop-Ups in malls across America. And the WWA badge can be used on product packaging and marketing materials in other online and physical retail locations, increasing customer confidence wherever your products are sold. 
“The Works with Alexa program opens up a huge number of opportunities for partnerships, visibility, and general customer awareness of our products,” says Fishman. “Works with Alexa has helped us grow our sales even faster by expanding both our online and offline footprint, while delivering a great experience to our customers.”

Tips for Submitting Test Account Credentials for Smart Home Skills;Thu Jan 31 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Aaron Tang;"With the increased popularity of Alexa-compatible smart devices, we’ve seen a surge in the number of smart home skill submissions. In 2018, there was a significant increase in Alexa-compatible devices, from 4,000 devices in January to over 28,000 devices from more than 4,500 brands in December. Developers around the world are enabled to connect any device to Alexa. Most of these skills are created using the Smart Home Skill API, but many are also created using a Custom Interaction Model. The certification process for smart home skills varies slightly based on the implementation method.

Our previous smart home blog, Tips for a Successful Alexa Smart Home Skill Certification, highlights important tips for a successful smart home skill certification. In this post, we’ll dive deep into the requirements for test account credentials as this is a certification requirement that you can easily check off and will help your skill get through certification as quickly as possible.

Smart home skills require account linking to control smart home devices. However, sometimes test credentials for account linking are not provided during skill submission, which results in the certification team being unable to successfully certify the skill, often leading to rejection. To avoid this common mistake when submitting your smart home skill for certification, be sure to provide test credentials (e.g., username and password) of the cloud-based device with which your skill will interact. The credentials should be submitted in the Testing Instructions field, located on the Distribution tab of the Developer Console, when you complete the Privacy & Compliance Page.
 
Tips for Submitting Test Account Credentials:

Make sure at least one device is discoverable on the device cloud associated with the testing credentials you provide.
Maintain the account credentials in a live status until you receive certification feedback for your skill or your skill has passed the certification process.
Ensure that the device(s) associated with the account are online and accessible until you receive certification feedback on the skill or your skill is published live.
Provide accurate account credentials (e.g. username and password) in the Testing Instructions.
Be sure to validate the test account credentials you provide with any subsequent submissions.
If the account is setup for two-step verification, then be sure to disable two-step verification. Without this, the verification code will not be accessible to certification team, causing delays and possible rejections.

Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta): How It Makes the Twerking Bear Groove to Amazon Music;Thu Jan 17 08:00:00 UTC 2019;Karen Yue;"Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta): How It Makes the Twerking Bear Groove to Amazon Music
Today, we are excited to announce a new addition to the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta) – the MusicData Interface which enables you to build Bluetooth-connected gadgets that respond to Amazon Music playing on an Echo device. Tens of millions of Alexa customers enjoy playing music on their Echo devices, and we’re excited to give you the ability to make that experience even more enjoyable with accompanying gadgets.
So how does it work? When a customer says “Alexa, play popular songs on Amazon Music” and the first song begins, a single value representing the average tempo of the song (expressed in beats per minute) is sent to the gadget in the form of a Tempo directive. Another directive is sent when a song stops or transitions to another song on the Echo device. With these directives, you can choose how you want your gadget to react to the BPM data shared. For example, you can map the data to control the speed of motors, flash colors based on predefined “fast” songs, and more. There are endless possibilities for you to build gadget experiences for Alexa customers to enjoy with music.
The functionality provided through the MusicData Interface will continue to grow, but here are some ways you can use tempo data to get started on your first gadget: build a hula girl that sways its hips, a disco ball that lights the room, or even a bear that twerks when Amazon Music is playing on an Echo device.
 
Alexa Gadgets Spotlight: MusicData Interface + Twerking Bear, by Gemmy Industries
Gemmy Industries introduced its customers to the world of twerking plush animatronics in 2015. Now, they have extended the fun to Alexa customers with Twerking Bear – an animated plush that brings fun into the home of Echo device owners. Twerking Bear is the first commercial product that uses the MusicData Interface.
The diagram below illustrates how all of this works. First, a customer requests a song from Amazon Music on their Echo device, and the command is processed in the cloud. Then, the Alexa Gadgets tempo directive with the BPM value is sent from the Echo device to Twerking Bear via Bluetooth. Based on the BPM value shared, Twerking Bear moves its body motors to the song played, pauses its motors when the song stops, and adjusts the speed of its motors when a new song begins.
Other Gadget Interfaces Used by Twerking Bear
In addition to music, Twerking Bear responds to speech, timers, alarms, reminders, wake word, and notifications – which are available in the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit. You can check out Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta): How It Makes the Echo Wall Clock Tick for more detail on these Gadget Interfaces.
Let’s take a look at how Twerking Bear responds to the following directives that are sent from an Echo device:
Speech
When Alexa starts speaking on an Echo device, Speechmarks Directives (SpeechData Interface) are sent to Twerking Bear with speechmark data. The Speechmarks Directives contain visemes, which are mouth positions that correspond to spoken sounds. Twerking Bear moves its mouth motors to demonstrate visual experiences of Alexa's text-to-speech (TTS) so that when a customer asks ""Alexa, what's the weather,"" he/she can observe Twerking Bear moving its mouth in sync with Alexa's response.
Wake Word Detection
When the wake word “Alexa” is detected on an Echo device, a StateUpdate Directive (StateListener Interface) is sent to Twerking Bear which includes the name and value of the state type. For the wakeword state, the valid values are active and cleared. When active, Twerking Bear tilts its head and moves its body motors for a dance movement that acknowledges the customer’s intent. This directive is also used for Twerking Bear to react to timers, alarms, and reminders on an Echo device.
 
Get Started with the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit
Available in the US, UK, and Germany, you can create your own gadget using one or more of the available Gadget Interfaces. The possibilities for designing delightful gadgets for customers to enjoy are endless. Visit our resources below to get started:

The Echo Button can blink while it’s hidden, or players can say “Alexa, disable the button lights” for a more challenging game. See Hackster project submission
 
Best Echo Buttons Kids Game ($2,000) – Animal Sounds
From LC Publishing, Animal Sounds is a kids game where customers tap Echo Buttons to hear animal sounds and then guess which animal it is! The developer was inspired by his childhood toys where he would push buttons and laugh at animal sounds for hours. He incorporated this same concept as an Echo Buttons game skill for Alexa customers to enjoy. He wanted to make it a learning experience, where you can ask, “Alexa, what does an Alpaca sound like?” Players who try this game on multimodal devices like Echo Show, will find images that complement their gameplay.

Best Echo Buttons Action Game ($1,500) – Pushup Trainer
From VocalSurvey, LLC, Pushup Trainer is a game skill that keeps track of a player's workout training plan, and counts the number of push-ups with a single Echo Button. This developer was excited to build this game for Echo Buttons, as he would press his phone screen using his nose to count pushups. He hired a voice actor to support the project, which enabled him to make his skill even more engaging. With this new skill and integration with fitness routines, we are excited to see what other developers will build using Echo Buttons. See Hackster project submission
 
Best Echo Buttons Trivia Game ($1,500) – Hoot Hoot
From Raspberry Mills, Hoot Hoot is a fun, trivia-style animal sounds game for young kids to learn their animal noises. The developer was inspired by her own daughter who is learning animal sounds for the first time. The game is played in three rounds, where Alexa asks a series of questions about what sounds animals make. Players buzz in using their Echo Buttons, and have a chance to answer. The winner is the player who has the most points after three rounds. See Hackster project submission
Congratulations to all our winners, and the entire community of developers who participated in the Echo Buttons Game Skills Contest.

Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta): How It Makes the Echo Wall Clock Tick;Wed Dec 19 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Lisa Mohanty;"Introduced in the US, UK, and Germany earlier this year, the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta) enables you to build your own Alexa Gadgets—fun and delightful accessories that connect to compatible Echo devices, and react to customer interactions with Alexa. The Alexa Gadgets Toolkit offers self-service APIs, including Gadget Interfaces which facilitate the sending of information from an Echo device to an Alexa Gadget. These Gadget Interfaces include wake word detection, speech, notifications, alerts (timers, alarms, and notifications), and time info (now available).
To illustrate how you can build your own Alexa Gadget, we are sharing how the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit was used to build Echo Wall Clock. Amazon built Echo Wall Clock for Echo device owners who enjoy using timers, alarms and reminders as a part of their daily routines.
 
Product Spotlight: Echo Wall Clock, an Alexa Gadget
Echo Wall Clock is a 10-inch battery powered clock that serves as an Echo companion for customers to see timers at a glance, helping them stay organized and on-time at home. The clock hands sync to the time on the Echo device to which it is paired, and automatically adjust to daylight savings time. With its 60 LED display, customers can say, “Alexa, set a 12-minute timer,” and their Echo Wall Clock will display the time remaining, as well as a countdown for the last 60 seconds.
To power these features, Echo Wall Clock uses the following Gadget Interfaces: time info, alerts, and notifications – all of which send information in form of directives from the paired Echo device. Here’s an illustration of what happens when a customer interacts with their Echo device, and how Echo Wall Clock responds:
When a customer interacts with certain features of their Echo device, they will see their Echo Wall Clock react. Let’s go a little deeper into how Echo Wall Clock responds to directives that are sent from an Echo device:
Time Info
When a customer pairs Echo Wall Clock to their Echo device, a StateListener Interface containing the current time of the Echo device is shared with Echo Wall Clock over Bluetooth. Echo Wall Clock uses this time info to trigger the clock’s hands to move to the same time as the Echo device. Echo Wall Clock periodically uses the StateListener Interface to remain in sync with the Echo device – from the customer’s first-time user experience and onward, including automatic updates for daylight savings.
Timers
When a customer sets a timer on their Echo device by saying “Alexa, set a 12-minute pasta timer,” the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit is used to enable the following experiences on Echo Wall Clock:
The clock uses the Alerts Interface’s SetAlert directive to illuminate the 60 LEDs to indicate how much time is left, with a countdown animation for the last 60 seconds.
When a customer cancels an existing timer, the same Alerts Interface with a DeleteAlert directive is received by the clock - triggering the removal of the timer illumination.
When a timer expires, Echo Wall Clock uses the StateListener Interface (StateUpdate directive of name:timer and value:active) to trigger the prescribed animation using the 60 LEDs.
Alarms and Reminders
When a customer sets a reminder on their Echo device by saying “Alexa, remind me to take out the laundry at 10:00am,” the Alerts Interface’s SetAlert directive is sent to Echo Wall Clock to trigger the display of a confirmation animation using the 60 LEDs. Customers have the same experience when setting an alarm. In both cases, all LEDs will pulse when an alarm or reminder expires.
Notifications
When a customer receives a notification on their Echo device, a Notification Interface SetIndicator directive is sent to Echo Wall Clock to trigger its status LED to pulse yellow for a limited time before automatically turning off. The status LED is located just below the center of the clock, and used to communicate the state of the device, including pairing and notifications. We chose to use the same yellow hue that represents notifications received on Echo devices.
Get Started with the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit
You too can create your own product similar to Echo Wall Clock using Alexa Gadgets Toolkit, or build something completely different using one or more of the available Gadget Interfaces. For example:  

Cuckoo clock that chirps at the top of every hour (reacts to time info) 
Workout gadget that sounds when a timed exercise concludes (reacts to timers)
Mug that lights up as a reminder to drink water (reacts to alarms and reminders)
Flag that pops up when a notification is received (reacts to notifications)

When you combine these ideas with additional Gadget Interfaces, such as wake word detection and speech data, the possibilities for designing delightful gadgets that customers will enjoy are endless.

Alexa Gets Smarter Every Day, Thanks to You: 2018 Alexa Developer Year in Review;Wed Dec 19 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Paul Cutsinger;"2018 has been a big year for Alexa, and as we look back we are humbled and inspired by what our Alexa developer community has done to make Alexa smarter, more useful, more fun, and more engaging for customers. Our mission is to have Alexa everywhere, and to help you, the developer community, build high-quality Alexa devices and engaging skills for customers.
There are hundreds of thousands of developers and device makers building Alexa experiences, contributing to our growing catalog of more than 70,000 skills in the Alexa Skills Store, and more than 28,000 Alexa-connected smart devices from more than 4,500 brands. Meanwhile, the number of available products with Alexa built-in more than doubled in 2018, and now includes everything from TVs and headphones, to PCs, cars, smart home devices, and more.
Before we look back at all the new tools, features, and programs we released this year to help you create magical voice experiences, let us first offer our “Thanks!” and “Happy Holidays!” to everyone in our worldwide Alexa developer community. Tell us about the great Alexa experiences you've built in 2018 by tweeting @alexadevs. Here are just a few highlights from 2018:
Alexa added a few more stamps to the passport this year, and is now available to customers in Australia and New Zealand, Ireland, India, France, Italy, Spain, and Mexico. Alexa also learned to speak to customers in French Canadian. Developers are already servicing these new locales by ensuring their skills are available in more languages and more locations, while Alexa built-in products from brands such as Sowee, Boulanger, Hama, Riva, Jabra, TIM, SWG Motorola and Grundig helped introduce Alexa to more customers around the world. If you haven't done so already, you can learn how to localize your Alexa skills.
Alexa is available on an ever-growing number of devices, whether they’re built by Amazon or by device makers building with the using the Alexa Voice Service. A growing selection of Alexa devices for customers means more opportunities for your skills to shine. 
To enable your skills to shine across device types, and specifically on devices with screens, we introduced the Alexa Presentation Language (APL). APL is designed from the ground up for creating voice-first, visual Alexa skills that adapt to different device types. Included in the Alexa Skills Kit (ASK), APL gives you flexible tools and resources to translate voice-first experiences to devices with screens. With APL, you can build skills that include text, graphics, slideshows, and video content, and control your user experience by defining where visual elements are placed on-screen. You can tailor experiences according to the unique characteristics of the Alexa device they are being rendered on, and can be targeted to devices with a broad range of memory and processing capabilities. To start building multimodal skills with APL, read our technical documentation and check out the Alexa Design Guide. Alongside the release of APL, we also introduced the Alexa Smart Screen SDK and dev kit, enabling device makers like Lenovo and Sony to create their own screen-based products with Alexa.
We're working to make Alexa accessible everywhere you are: around the house, on-the-go, and everywhere in between. Alexa is now available through the Alexa app and products built using the Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit, such as headphones and wearables. And we brought Alexa to the car by releasing the Alexa Auto SDK for automakers and suppliers to embed Alexa directly into the car, and by introducing the all-new Echo Auto.
Alexa is also in the places where you work and travel, with Alexa for Business and Alexa for Hospitality. For device makers, this means more opportunities to build products for businesses and organizations. For skill builders, this means a growing set of engaging customer scenarios you can target, and new tools and APIs that help you build new experiences. With Alexa for Business, employees can use Alexa as their intelligent assistant to be more productive in meeting rooms, at their desks, and even with the Alexa devices they already have at home. Alexa for Hospitality brings the simplicity and convenience of Alexa voice control to hotels, allowing guests to request hotel information, contact the hotel to request services, play music, adjust the thermostat and more.
More than ever before, developers are building thriving voice-first businesses with Alexa. In addition to the Alexa Developer Rewards program, Alexa developer promotions, and AWS promotional credits, this year we released new skill monetization opportunities, including Amazon Pay for Alexa skills, and in-skill purchasing (ISP) for premium content within skills. With ISP, you can sell premium content to enrich your Alexa skill experience with one-time purchases for entitlements that unlock access to features or content in your skill, subscriptions that offer access to premium features or content for a period of time, and consumables which can be purchased, depleted and purchased again. After adding in-skill purchasing to two of his most popular game skills, Gal Shenar from Stoked Skills is seeing conversion rates as high as 34%. And Steve Arkonovich added a monthly subscription to unlock personalized, premium features to his popular weather skill, Big Sky, and is seeing 50% of customers opting to purchase the premium experience when offered. To get started, check out our resources on building Alexa skills with ISP.
It's striking to look back just one year, and consider the expanded range of options you have to build engaging Alexa skills. We completely revamped the ASK Developer Console, with a refreshed user interface and new functionality, making it easier than ever to manage the entire lifecycle of your Alexa skill. We also released new and enhanced software development kits (SDKs) for Node.js, Java, and Python, and the ASK Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (Beta), enabling you to leverage the developer environments and languages you already use. We announced the developer preview of Alexa-hosted skills, a new offering that automatically provisions and manages a set of AWS cloud resources for your skill’s back-end service, enabling you to build, edit, and publish a skill without leaving the ASK Developer Console. We also introduced quick-start template for popular skill samples, and released the Alexa Skill Management API (SMAPI) and ASK Command Line Interface (CLI) to enable faster, more automated skill management.
For device makers, we introduced single-chip solutions from leading chip providers that simplifies the architecture and bill-of-materials (BOM) of products with Alexa Built-in, worked with original design manufacturers (ODMs) to provide an accelerated path for product development with white-box solutions, and qualified systems integrators that offer technology solutions and design services with expertise in building devices using the Alexa Voice Service (AVS).
Device makers have already connected more than 28,000 smart devices from more than 4,500 brands to Alexa – a 6x increase since January. This year we introduced new developer tools that make device setup easier for customers and let you extend voice control to any device - from the simplest wall plug to the most complex appliance - and to any feature of your device. New device capability interfaces and APIs are now available for kitchen appliances, contact and motion sensors, security systems, devices in low power mode, recorded camera feeds, equalizer and sound modes, recording and other video controls, and more. And the new building block device APIs enable you to add voice control to nearly any device and any feature. And Alexa can now be directly built into home hub and gateway devices with newly qualified ODM solutions. We also released new smart device integration options, so you can connect your device control cloud to Alexa with the Smart Home Skill API, use Zigbee to connect locally, or connect directly using the Amazon-managed hardware module and cloud service provided with the Alexa Connect Kit (preview). You can also build your very own Alexa Gadgets – fun and delightful accessories that pair to compatible Echo devices via Bluetooth – using the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta). And finally, we introduced the new Works with Alexa (WWA) console (beta), which provides a streamlined experience to help you achieve WWA certification for your smart devices, allowing you to join the more than 8,000 WWA-certified smart home devices available to customers today.
Whether you want to entertain or teach, you can build skills that engage young minds. And in 2018, we also released new devices, tools, and programs to help you reach the next generation of Alexa customers. The Echo Dot Kids Edition was designed with families in mind and kids skills are now available in the UK, Germany, India, Australia, and New Zealand. And kid skills in the UK and Germany are now eligible to earn Alexa Developer Rewards. Learn more with our guide to building stellar kids skills.
To enable richer, more engaging Alexa experiences, this year we released a number of new tools and APIs. For skill developers and device makers, we:

Improved skill discoverability tools make it easier for customers to find and engage with your skills. Using CanFulfillIntentRequest, your skill provides information about its ability to fulfill a given customer request, and Alexa combines this information with a machine-learning model to choose the right skill to use when a customer makes a request without an invocation name. As a result, customers find the right skill faster, using the search terms they say most naturally.


Made dialog management improvements to enable you to use the built-in Yes/No intents side-by-side with dialog management, additional built-in slot types, and slot validation to create more natural conversations, simplify dialog management, and help save time in your skill development.


Introduced real-time location services for Alexa skills, enabling you to request permission to provide customers with real-time responses based on their location. You can also request customer contact information using the Customer Profile API. And the Alexa Settings API allows you to build skills that reference a customer’s preferred time zone and units of measure for distance and temperature.


Brought new ways to test and validate example phrases for your Alexa skills, providing in-line, real-time validation feedback.


Provided deeper insights into how customers are engaging with your Alexa skill with Intent History and new debugging tools to show you where additional samples might help train your model to resolve utterances to their intended intents and slots, and with interaction path analysis to show you aggregated skill usage patterns in a visual format, including which intents your customers use and in what order.


Extended access to 27 different Amazon Polly voices to make your Alexa skills more engaging for customers, enabling you to choose a different voice for any utterance, reduce the time and cost required to hire voice actors, and customize pronunciation. 


Introduced the ASK sound library, which provides built-in audio clips that you can add to your Alexa skills, making it easy for you to create an engaging customer experience by adding unique sounds to your skill, including hundreds of sounds from 14 categories including cartoon, home, human, nature, and transportation, and more. 


Launched the new Fallback Intent to help you handle unexpected utterances, or when a customer says something that doesn’t map to any intents in your skill.


Added skill activation metrics to help you quickly diagnose and correct skill activation errors that might cause customer friction with your skill, and the ability to make account linking optional enabling customers to simply enable your skill and start engaging with the parts of your skill that do not need authentication.


Announced the Skill Connections (preview) to enable you to do more for your customers – including printing, and scheduling taxis and restaurants – using functionality provided by other skills.


Launched the ProactiveEvents API that enables your Alexa skills to send notifications to customers who have granted permissions. By providing timely, relevant information, you can keep your customers engaged and retain them effectively.


Introduced cloud-based Echo Spatial Perception (ESP), providing a frustration-free experience for customers with multiple Alexa devices by automatically identifying which device is closest to the customer, and responding through that device.


Provided mechanisms for Alexa Built-in devices to report their device capabilities including support for new interfaces after over-the-air updates by using the Capabilities API.


Enhanced device support for voice-based timers, alarms, and reminders using the Alerts interface.


Enabled device makers to support Alexa Routines via the Interaction Model interface, so customers can automate a series of actions using a single voice command of their choice. For example, a customer could say, “Alexa, it's bedtime,” to turn off the lights, lock the door, and turn off the TV.


Published guidelines for setting up test rooms while performing acoustic product testing and best practices for device security for cloud-connected products with Alexa Built-in.
The Alexa team participates in a variety of in-person events all over the world and next year we’d love to meet you at one. You can get hands-on instruction and learn to build an Alexa skill at a bootcamp or hackathon, attend a presentation at smart home events, join in the conversation at select conferences, or connect with fellow developers at a local meetup. You can check out the latest Alexa devices from Amazon and other companies at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2019), held from January 8 to 11 in Las Vegas, NV.
Another great opportunity to learn more about Alexa skill development, improve your skills, and enter to win prizes is through the Alexa Skills Challenge. This year we crowned grand prize and bonus category winners in challenges specific to Kids, Life Hacks, Tech for Good, and Games. And right now, you can create an Alexa skill using APL and enter the Alexa Skills Challenge: Multimodal. In addition to helping push the boundaries of what's possible with voice and visuals, you can compete for up to $150,000 in prize. And you can earn a new Amazon device just by publishing an APL skill. Eligible skills must be submitted by January 22, 2019.

Alexa, Arm My Security System. Now You Can Connect Security Systems with Alexa Using the Security Panel Controller API;Tue Dec 11 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Brian Crum;"We are excited to announce the Security Panel Controller API, enabling your customers to control their security systems via Alexa-enabled devices. Once you’ve implemented the Security Panel Controller API, your customers can arm, disarm, and query their security systems with Alexa. Alexa supports arming in away, home or stay, and night modes. The Security Panel Controller API is available today in the US, and security system providers such as ADT, Ring, Honeywell Home, abode, and Scout Alarm are already leveraging these new smart home capabilities.
 
How the Security Panel Controller API Works
Arming or disarming a security system is done using the Arm and Disarm directives. The Arm and Disarm directives signal that a customer has asked Alexa to activate or deactivate their security system. Customer utterances that support Arm are, “Alexa, arm <device name> in <mode type> mode,” and “Alexa, arm.” If a customer doesn’t specify a mode, the default arming mode is stay mode (a.k.a. home mode). Customer utterances that support Disarm are “Alexa, disarm <device name>,” and “Alexa, disarm.” Here is what the arm and disarm requests would look like:
Arm Directive:
Disarm Directive:
Security panel customers must enable the disarm-by-voice feature in order to use the Disarm capabilities. Customers can enable disarm-by-voice during set-up flow or by visiting their panel’s settings page in the Alexa app. If your security system supports 4-digit PIN codes known to your security system control cloud, customers can choose to use either their existing PIN or an Alexa-specific voice code to disarm their system. If your security system does not support 4-digit PIN codes known to your cloud, customers must create an Alexa-specific voice code to disarm.
Security panel providers such as ADT, Ring, Honeywell Home, abode, and Scout Alarm are already leveraging the Security Controller APIs, and customers can use their respective skills today. To get started, you can follow the instructions in the Security Panel Controller API documentation.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/12/alexa-arm-my-security-system-customers-can-now-control-their-security-systems-with-alexa-using-the-security-panel-controller-api;
New Alexa Smart Home Developer Tools Enable Seamless Voice Control of Any Device and Any Feature - New Toggle, Mode, and Range Capabilities are Generally Available in the Smart Home Skill API;Tue Dec 04 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Brian Crum;"In September, we announced the updated Smart Home Skill API (Preview), which included several changes that enable you to integrate any feature of any device with Alexa. Today, we are happy to announce that some of these changes - the new Mode, Range, and Toggle capability interfaces - are now generally available in the US. You can configure these capability interfaces to model many different features, though they are particularly well-suited to device settings and modes such as fan speed, oscillation, auto mode, and many others.
 
How You Can Use the New Toggle, Mode, and Range Capabilities
Mode controllers set one value from a group of settings that are ordered (Low, Medium, High) or unordered (Auto, Heavy, Normal, Turbo). This allows commands like ""Alexa, set the dishwasher to auto"" or ""Alexa, set the wash cycle to cottons."" If the controller is ordered, your customers can say things like ""Alexa, increase the fan speed"" where a fan endpoint defines an ordered Alexa.ModeController called speed that supports values of Low, Medium, and High.

Range controllers enable interaction with a numeric range. This allows setting a numeric value like ""Alexa, set the living room fan speed to 5."" Ranges also support custom, named presets like ""Alexa, set the fan speed on the living room fan to maximum"" where the value of maximum maps to a value of 10 in the range. You can use a Range controller to report the state of a range like ""Alexa, what is the speed of the living room fan?"" and configure each instance by defining a minimum, maximum, precision, and unit of measure like gallons, meters, pounds, liters, and more. This allows for very specialized commands like ""Alexa, set the blinds angle to 45 degrees"" where the unit of measure is Alexa.Unit.Angle.Degrees with a supported range of 30-60 in precision increments of 5.

Toggle controllers turn features on or off. They support commands like ""Alexa, turn off oscillate on the fan"" or ""Alexa, turn on overdrive on the guitar amp.""

You can use multiple instances of each controller interface on a single endpoint, which gives you extra flexibility in the way you model your device to Alexa. You give each instance a friendly name such as “zone 1” or “zone 2” for two toggles on a sprinkler system. You can also provide additional friendly names, so your customers have the flexibility to use any names that make sense. For example, the Alexa.ToggleController for “zone 1” of the sprinkler system might have alternate names of “zone A,” “backyard,” or “roses.” By providing multiple names, customers can use utterance variations like ""turn off sprinkler zone 1,"" or ""turn off the roses sprinkler."" For more details, see the resources and assets documentation.

While these new capabilities allow you to customize many of the supported utterances for your devices, they don't give you full flexibility to define any custom utterance. If you want to provide custom utterances like “water the lawn,” “brew the coffee,” or “wash my clothes,” you can create a custom model to provide these utterances. However, in order to use both custom and smart home models in a single skill, you will need to sign up for the updated Smart Home Skill API Preview. For a deeper look at the technical details and to apply to the preview, please see Understanding the Updated Smart Home Skill API (Preview).
 
How to Take Advantage of these New Capabilities in Your Smart Home Skill
If you currently have a smart home skill, or are just getting started with Alexa Smart Home, you can now incorporate the new interfaces as part of your discovery message.

If you currently have a custom skill and are thinking about making the switch to a smart home skill to take advantage of these new APIs, we recommend you don't create an additional smart home skill that your customers would need to enable separately. Instead, please apply for the Smart Home Skill API (Preview) in order to support smart home utterances and custom utterances in a single skill. If you already have both a custom skill and a smart home skill today, apply for the Smart Home Skill API (Preview) in order to combine them into a single skill.
A few device makers participating in the Smart Home Skill API (Preview) are already using these new APIs to add new functionality to their existing skills. Kenmore is using the new ModeController to give their customers a set of additional wash cycle presets that are voice exclusive to Alexa. Netgear is using ToggleControllers for guest Wi-Fi. Moen is using all three new APIs to add fully native voice and routines support for their smart showers. Michael Poloha, Group Manager Digital & IoT, Moen Incorporated shared, ""The new Amazon Smart Home APIs have allowed us to add new functionality to the U by Moen shower. These new APIs give consumers the ability to integrate their shower into groups and routines to create an even better showering experience, all while using natural voice commands to activate and control their shower.""

Accelerate Smart Device Certification with the New Works with Alexa Console (Beta);Tue Nov 20 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Brian Crum;"We are excited to announce the new Works with Alexa (WWA) console (beta), which provides a streamlined experience to help you achieve WWA certification for your smart devices. Previously, WWA certification was managed exclusively via email, occasionally leading to delays in certification. Now, the new WWA console makes it easier to submit your smart devices for certification, monitor their application status, and respond quickly to any testing failures – ultimately accelerating end-to-end WWA certification time. The WWA console also makes it easier for you to submit certified devices for WWA logo badging. You can take advantage of the WWA console (beta) today, in all locales, to edit an existing device certification application or to create a new one.
The new WWA console simplifies the certification application process by allowing you to share your general product information, including device type, capabilities, connection type, and setup information via a simplified web form. Also, you only have to provide information for a product model once, even though they you might submit your product for certification and badging multiple times. Within the WWA console, you may submit a certification request for any registered product, track the status of your request, and review the request’s results. We’ve also streamlined the WWA badging request process, enabling you to quickly add the WWA badge to certified devices, making it easier for customers to find your WWA certified products.
Boost Exposure for Your Smart Devices with the WWA Program
Works with Alexa (WWA) is a certification program that verifies the responsiveness, reliability, and functionality of Alexa-connected devices, ensuring your customers have the best smart device experiences. When your products are certified, they can carry the WWA badge on product packaging, appear in the Alexa Smart Home Store, and can be considered for additional co-marketing opportunities. This increases customer confidence that your products integrate seamlessly with Alexa, which in turn increases traffic to your products in the Amazon Smart Home Store and offline channels. There are currently more than 20,000 smart home devices that can be controlled with Alexa, from more than 3,500 unique brands. Customers have already connected tens of millions of smart home products to Alexa. To qualify for the WWA program, your product must satisfy the eligibility and product requirements in the Works with Alexa Program Guidelines. Once you have thoroughly tested your product, you can register and submit you product for certification in the new WWA console.
 
Submit Your Smart Devices for WWA Certification Today
You can use the new WWA console to submit your smart devices for WWA certification, or to manage an existing WWA certification request. All historical certification and badging records are in the process of being migrated to our new system, and will be available by December 31, 2018. No additional action is required for active or pending projects that have already been submitted to our testing facility. If your request has not yet been submitted for testing, please register and submit them directly through the new WWA console for a faster response. Please contact us at wwa-beta@amazon.com for any assistance needed, and share your feedback via the Alexa Forums. For more information about the WWA console, please refer to our WWA documentation, and WWA program guidelines.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/11/simplify-and-accelerate-your-smart-device-certification-in-the-new-works-with-alexa-console-beta;
Introducing the AVS Hosted Splash Screen;Wed Nov 07 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Sanjay Ramaswamy;"Today, the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) is introducing an AVS Hosted Splash screen to create a better and more consistent Alexa registration experience for devices with Alexa built-in. We are introducing the AVS Hosted Splash screen for two reasons: to eliminate the time device makers spend engineering their own webview to host an Alexa splash screen and to help improve customer engagement with Alexa built-in products. Amazon will continuously monitor and regularly improve the AVS Hosted Splash screen, which currently features three content zones optimized for registrations: graphic, copy, and call-to-action. This will also ensure consistency of the Alexa registration experience across all devices.
You will need to request the new alexa:voice_service:pre_auth scope and the alexa:all scope when requesting Login with Amazon (LWA) to register a new customer (and remove your existing splash screen if applicable). The AVS Hosted Splash screen will then be deployed automatically to the device that creates a LWA request in the companion app. See our documentation for more details.
If you already have a product in market, you can choose to either keep your existing splash screen or update to the AVS Hosted Splash screen. If you are developing a new product, you must use the AVS Hosted Splash screen and you no longer need to build and host your own Alexa splash screen.

Now Alexa Can Power on Devices in Low Power Mode with the Wake-on-LAN Controller;Tue Nov 06 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Brian Crum;"We’re excited to introduce the Wake-on-LAN Controller, which enables customers to use Alexa to power on smart devices that have gone into a low power mode and cannot be woken up via the cloud. Now, whenever a customer wants to power on a smart device, typically a TV or other entertainment equipment, that has gone into low power mode using only voice, they can simply say, ""Alexa, turn on my TV.” The associated smart home skill then uses the Wake-on-LAN Controller to send a directive to a customer’s Echo devices, resulting in a Wake-on-LAN (WoL) packet being broadcast over the customer's local area network (LAN) or WiFi. Although device makers can already use the Alexa Smart Home API to control TVs and other equipment, until today customers were often not able to power on devices in low power mode. We have now delivered an alternative that can help power on devices, without requiring device makers to make hardware changes.
Using the Wake-on-LAN Controller has three main benefits:

Powers on devices in low power mode: The Wake-on-LAN Controller uses the standard Wake-on-LAN / Wake on Wireless LAN protocol to power on devices that are in a low power mode and cannot otherwise be turned on via the cloud. The customer’s Echo Devices, connected on the same network as the targeted smart device, will then transmit the WoL packets using the MAC addresses and enables Alexa to power on your WoL capable devices.
Provides a consistent customer experience, with no additional customer interaction needed: The controller provides a consistent experience to customers where they can ask Alexa to turn on devices and the device can be turned on irrespective of the power state of the device. Customers who have enabled the skill associated with their TV or other entertainment device will not need to take any additional steps to enable the feature.
Works with the power controller: As a device manufacturer, when an Alexa request is sent to you, you can decide whether you want to wake up the device using your cloud or you want Alexa to execute the request using the WoL protocol.
 

How to Implement the Wake-on-LAN Controller
As a device maker, if you want to use WoL to power on your devices, your devices must support WoL protocol, and you need to follow these steps:
1. Build an Alexa smart home skill: Your Alexa skill will be used to send commands that will enable you to accept Alexa commands such as Turn on TV, Volume up on TV and you can execute these requests on customer devices.
2. Add the Wake-on-LAN Controller interface to your skill: Implement the WakeOnLANController interface and PowerController interface in your skill. When Alexa send you a discovery request, in the WakeOnLANController configuration object, you provide the device’s MAC address. This helps Alexa understand that the device the customer intends to control supports Wake-on-LAN. When a customer asks “Alexa, turn on TV”, then Alexa will send you a Turn on Directive which is part of PowerController capability of the skill. As with existing Alexa.Discovery directives, the Discover.Response event containing the MAC Address configuration is sent securely through an Alexa Smart Home Lambda event source.
3. Send a deferred response: Once you have identified that the device needs to be woken up by the cloud, send a deferred response to Alexa. This indicates that a message will be sent to event gateway for Wake-on-LAN Controller execution.
4. Send events to the Alexa gateway: Your skill will send a wake up event to the Alexa events gateway. Alexa will then process this event and broadcast Wake-on-LAN packets, via the Echo devices in the customer’s account, using the MAC address that you provided during the discovery response for the device.
5. Send a change report event: Monitor the status of device and send a change report event to the Alexa event gateway when the TV powers on.
VIZIO, LG, and Hisense TVs have adopted this feature and will be rolling it out to their customers in the next several months. We are looking forward to seeing your response to these new capabilities. To learn more about the Wake-on-LAN Controller, see our technical documentation.

Announcing Alexa for Business Support for Products with Alexa Built-in;Wed Oct 24 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Sanjay Ramaswamy;"Last fall, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced Alexa for Business, giving companies the ability to introduce Alexa to their organization and build custom and scalable voice experiences. Since its launch, companies like Express Trucking, Fender, and Propel Insurance have used Alexa for Business to add Amazon Echo devices to meeting rooms, workspaces, and other shared environments, enabling employees to interact with the technology at work using just their voice. We’ve made it simple to pair an Amazon Echo with existing office equipment, but we also heard from many organizations that they’d like Alexa built into their existing devices to minimize the amount of technology they need to manage and monitor.
Today, we’re excited to announce that device makers building with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) can now create fully integrated solutions, so their products can be registered with Alexa for Business and managed as shared devices in organizations. Alexa for Business customers will soon be able to centrally manage and deploy supported products with Alexa built-in – whether it’s built by Amazon or third-party device makers.
With a simple extension to the AVS Device SDK, device makers can leverage Alexa for Business to bring the power of voice to enterprises. Together, the solutions allow for: (1) deployment of third-party devices to shared spaces such as conference rooms, hotel and dorm rooms, lobbies, kitchens, break rooms, and copy rooms, (2) device management as part of the device makers' existing management flow, such as room designation, device health monitoring, and location setting and (3) skill management, such as public and private skill assignment for shared devices without publishing to the public Alexa Skills Store.
""Customers love using Alexa on Echo devices to simplify meeting room experiences and have asked us to enable the same experiences on their existing equipment,” said Collin Davis, GM, Alexa for Business. “We are excited to be working with device makers to bring the power of Alexa to our customers through the devices they already use around the office. Customers get all the benefits of Alexa for Business without having to install any new hardware.""
“The ability to create Alexa built-in products for the enterprise represents a significant opportunity for device makers,” added Pete Thompson, VP of the Alexa Voice Service. “With a simple extension to the AVS Device SDK, device makers can address the growing demand for voice in organizations and deliver new voice-based solutions that simplify tasks and enhance productivity.”
We are working with popular brands like Plantronics, iHome, and BlackBerry, and solution providers like Linkplay and Extron to bring delightful and productive Alexa experiences to organizations.
“Plantronics creates simple audio experiences to enable customers to make critical connections,” said Laura Marx, VP of Alliance Marketing at Plantronics. “We’ve been using Alexa for Business since its launch by pairing Echo devices with existing Polycom equipment, and integrating those experiences directly into products like Polycom Trio will take our customer experience to the next level of convenience and ease of use.”
“We’re excited to extend our collaboration with Amazon to bring Alexa for Business capabilities to iHome devices with Alexa built-in,” said Gary Schultz, Director of Business and Product Development at iHome. “By enabling our products to be deployed and managed across new environments, we’re able to reach more people and deliver additional Alexa functionality for customers.”
The Alexa for Business capabilities are provided as an extension to the AVS Device SDK, starting with version 1.10, available to download from Github. For device makers looking to learn more about how to build for or enable existing Alexa built-in devices with Alexa for Business as shared devices, please see our documentation.

Announcing Doorbell Chime Announcements and 2-Way Communication APIs, Unlocking New Customer Scenarios in Home Automation and Monitoring;Tue Oct 09 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Brian Crum;"Today, we are happy to announce new doorbell APIs for smart home cameras and doorbells, unlocking new customer scenarios in home automation and monitoring. By updating your smart home skill to use either or both of the new Doorbell Event Source and Motion Sensor APIs, you can enable your customers to connect their doorbell press and camera motion sensors to Alexa. These new additions to the Smart Home Skill API are available today in the US, with support for additional locales coming soon. By implementing these APIs, customers can turn on voice “Announcements” for your smart home camera or doorbell by visiting the smart home section of the Alexa App. Customers can also set up smart home automations using doorbell or motion events like turning on lights, playing music or custom announcements using Routines within the Alexa app. Ring and August have implemented these new APIs so that customers can take advantage of the benefits of smart home automation.
In addition to the above APIs, we have also released the 2-Way Communication API that enables smart cameras and doorbells to establish a 2-way communication with Echo Show and Echo Spot. Ring has implemented the 2-way communication API and this feature is coming soon with August. We currently support only WebRTC compliant cameras or 3Ps who use a WebRTC bridge to connect to Alexa. Alexa voice commands are currently only available for full duplex cameras. Half duplex cameras will have push to talk capabilities on the Echo Show or Echo Spot.

"""Alexa, Play Rolling in the Deep Everywhere."" Announcing Multi-Room Music for Products with Alexa Built-in";Thu Sep 20 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Sanjay Ramaswamy;"There are millions of people who own multiple devices with Alexa built-in, and these customers want to be able to combine their speakers to create whole-home audio experiences. That’s why we created Alexa Multi-Room Music (MRM), which enables you to play music synchronized on multiple Echo devices throughout your home. The Alexa App lets you create a group with two or more Echo devices and name it such as “Living Room.” You can then simply say, “Alexa, play my music in the Living Room.”
But customers don’t just have Echo devices in their home. They also have speakers from other brands with Alexa built-in. When we announced Alexa MRM last year, we also announced a developer preview of tools for device makers to create multi-room experiences. Today, we’re excited to make these tools available for all device makers to integrate Alexa MRM into their products. By doing so, customers can group Alexa MRM-compatible products across brands (including Echo devices) to create delightful multi-room experiences.
Prototype with a Development Kit: You can prototype using the Alexa MRM-qualified i.MX 8M development kit from NXP. We have provided the Alexa MRM binaries for this dev kit in the ‘Resources’ section of the AVS Developer Portal.
Accelerate with Solution Providers: Bring your devices to market faster with an Alexa MRM solution from a Systems Integrator (Libre LS9 or Linkplay A98) or a turnkey Alexa MRM solution from an Original Design Manufacturer (Tonly).
Build Your Own with the AVS Device SDK: If your device meets the minimum hardware and software requirements for Alexa MRM, you can work with us to get binaries built for your platform. You can use these binaries with the AVS Device SDK to create multi-room music experiences.
“Our customers are passionate about music. It is a true delight to be able to play synchronized music in multiple rooms of your house using just your voice, and we’re thrilled to give AVS developers access to the same Alexa MRM experience available on Amazon Echo devices,” said Priya Abani, Director, Amazon Alexa. “Developers, systems integrators, and ODMs can use this generally available Alexa MRM solution, and we can’t wait to see them bring the experience to more devices and customers over time.”
Many popular brands are integrating Alexa MRM into their speakers for customers to play synchronized music across a multi-brand group of Alexa built-in devices. This will be available to customers of these devices in the coming weeks via an over-the-air update.
Harman Kardon, a premier speaker company, will issue a software update to enable Alexa MRM on their existing Alexa Built-in Allure speaker, allowing their customers to play synchronized music in a group along with other Alexa devices. “Multi-Room Music allows customers to enjoy crisp, synchronized sound across multiple Allure speakers and Alexa-enabled devices,” said Dave Rogers, President, Consumer Audio at Harman Kardon. “A simplified configuration process done via the Alexa App makes Harman Kardon Allure speakers even more versatile and delightful for customers.”
Sound United is adding Alexa MRM functionality to their recently-launched Polk Command Bar: “The Polk Command Bar with Alexa built-in already sounds awesome and functions as an incredibly simple and convenient way to access music, movies, TV, and other content in your home entertainment center via voice,” said Brendon Stead, SVP Product Development and Engineering at Sound United. “Now with the addition of Alexa Multi-Room Music, users can easily group the Command Bar with other MRM-enabled or Alexa devices, regardless of brand, to distribute great-sounding audio content anywhere throughout the home.”
Alexa MRM is just one of several new features available to speakers makers building with Alexa. In addition to today’s release, we are also working to bring additional capabilities to device makers such as stereo pairs (to play left/right channel separately), subwoofer pairs (to combine speakers for more accurate reproduction of frequencies at the bass and mid/high ranges), and preferred speaker setup (to set a speaker or a multi-room music group for streaming music playback).
In the Amazon Alexa App, create a group of devices named Living Room.
To initiate playback on the group

“Alexa, play Rolling Stones in the Living Room.”

After playback begins

“Alexa, pause music in the Living Room.”
“Alexa, pause.” (pauses the active group) 
“Alexa, next on the Living Room.”
“Alexa, next.” (makes the active group move on to play the next song)
“Alexa volume 5 on the Living Room.” 
“Alexa volume 5.” (control volume on device you are speaking to)

Interrupt during playback

“Alexa, what’s the weather?”  (volume drops on the device you are speaking to, and weather info is played)

New Alexa Smart Home Developer Tools Enable Seamless Voice Control of Any Device and Any Feature;Thu Sep 20 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Rick Carragher;"Editor's note: we are happy to announce that some of the updates noted below - the new Mode, Range, and Toggle capability interfaces - are now generally available in the US. The associated developer previews described below are now closed. Learn more. 
Device makers have already connected more than 20,000 smart devices, from more than 3,500 brands, to Alexa. Today, we’re excited to announce new developer tools in preview that make device setup easier for customers and let you extend voice control to any device - from the simplest wall plug to the most complex appliance - and to any feature of your device. With the updated Smart Home Skill API, you can use new toggle, range, and mode APIs as building blocks to model the complete feature set of your device, and combine native Alexa smart home skill utterances and your own custom utterances in a single skill. With Wi-Fi simple setup, a part of the Frustration-Free Setup program, you can simplify customer setup of Wi-Fi devices using the same approach we use on Amazon devices such as Echo and Fire TV. Finally, with the Alexa Connect Kit, you can connect any device to the Internet and Alexa by integrating a hardware module over a simple serial interface, without worrying about managing cloud services, Alexa skills, or complex networking and security firmware.
 
Use the Updated Smart Home Skill API (Preview) to Add Voice Control for All of Your Features in a Single Skill
We’re adding new capabilities for smart home skills that let you take advantage of Alexa’s native voice user interface (VUI) for more of the features of your device, and extend the VUI with your own custom intents. With these new tools, you can support any smart device you can imagine, and deliver the right voice user interface for all of your current features and any you invent in the future. The updated API, available in preview in the US starting today, allows you to:

Use new Toggle, Range, and Mode interfaces to add native voice support for a broad range of smart device features. Alexa already supports the most common smart device features, such as turning on lights and locking doors; these new primitives give you the flexibility to control many more. You can use toggle for features with binary states, range for features with numeric values, and mode for features with multiple, named states. In addition, you can use these building block APIs multiple times for a single device. For example, if you build smart guitar amplifiers, you might use toggle to turn on “overdrive,” range for ""gain"" and ""master"" dials, and mode for presets such as “jazz,” “blues,” and “rock.” Your customers could say, “Alexa, turn on overdrive,” “Alexa set the gain to eight,” and “Alexa, change the tone to jazz.” 
Add custom intents to complete the voice experience for your customers. You can now combine native Alexa smart home intents with custom intents that you define, in a single skill, to let your device’s features shine through in the VUI just as you designed them. You can support unique utterances and unique features outside Amazon’s native smart home VUI. For example, your guitar amplifier skill can support “Alexa, more bass” or “Alexa, give me that Vox chime” as alternatives to specifying different ranges and modes. You can support utterances like “Alexa, what is a crunch tone?” to provide voice access to help information. You could even add Easter eggs like “Alexa, crank it up to eleven.”
Combine all of your native and custom intents in a single skill. By combining native and custom intents in a single smart home skill, you can enable customers to use their voices to easily interact with your devices in all the ways that you can imagine, including unique utterances and branding. Setup becomes easier because customers need to enable only a single skill for your device, and usage becomes easier because customers will be able to say “Alexa, <perform action>” instead of “Alexa, ask <skill name> to <perform action>” for your custom intents.

Several device makers are already developing with the updated smart home skill API:

Moen is adding the new toggle, mode, and range interfaces to their U by Moen Shower skill to provide support for simple phrases such as, “Alexa, set my shower to 100 degrees.”
Ecobee is moving the intents in their custom Ecobee Plus skill – including equipment status queries and vacation scheduling – into their Ecobee smart home skill. Customers will only have to enable a single skill, and can simply say, “Alexa, is heating enabled?” and “Alexa, return to my schedule.”
iRobot is working to enable name-free Roomba intents like “Alexa, schedule a cleaning job with {robot_name}” and “Alexa, schedule a cleaning job for {time} with all of my robots.”

In the coming months, we will also extend our native smart home APIs with additional doorbell, camera, and security system capabilities. You’ll be able to use Alexa to notify customers when someone rings the doorbell, and use Alexa to talk to your visitor. You’ll also be able to use the new SecurityPanelController interface to enable customers to arm and disarm your security systems, and query for system status.
 
Introducing the Frustration-Free Setup Program and the Wi-Fi Simple Setup SDK and Service (Preview)
Getting smart devices connected to the Internet is still too difficult, which is why today we announced the Frustration-Free Setup program to help remove or reduce steps in setting up connected devices. Last year, we made setup easier with Zigbee simple setup, available on Amazon devices with a built-in smart home hub like Echo Plus and the new Echo Show. Today, we are introducing Wi-Fi simple setup, an SDK and service that helps customers connect smart home devices to Wi-Fi. When a new smart home device that incorporates the Wi-Fi simple setup SDK is powered on for the first time, it searches for and connects to the Wi-Fi simple setup network established by other devices in the home. This network is used to authenticate the device, securely connect to the Amazon Wi-Fi locker, an encrypted cloud credential store, and deliver a customer’s stored home network credentials to the new device. Our goal with Wi-Fi simple setup is not just to simplify setup but also to reduce costs for device makers that come through customer support calls and device returns.
Any Wi-Fi smart home device can host the Wi-Fi simple setup network and any smart home device that has implemented the Wi-Fi simple setup SDK can seamlessly connect to it. The SDK, which has been built for embedded Linux and will be available for other embedded platforms in the future, is provided for free for device makers. We are already working with partners including Wemo, eero, Kasa Smart by TP-Link, and TP-Link to bring the Wi-Fi simple setup experience to devices launching next year. 
 
Connect to Alexa via a Serial Port using the Alexa Connect Kit (Preview)
The Alexa Connect Kit (Preview), or ACK, gives you the tools to turn any device with a microcontroller (MCU) into a smart device. Simply add an Amazon-managed ACK module to your device, connect it to your device’s MCU over a serial interface, and add ACK interface code to your device’s firmware to interpret control messages from the module. To make the integration as easy as possible, the ACK development kit includes a sample MCU equipped with sample code you can port to your device’s specific MCU. The module uses Wi-Fi to securely connect your device to Amazon-managed cloud services that provide Alexa control, Wi-Fi simple setup, Dash Replenishment Service, and all the device metrics and logs you need to manage devices in the field. With an ACK module on your device, you can focus on building great hardware. ACK provides you:

A simple way to connect your device to Alexa. With ACK, you don’t have to build and manage cloud services or write complex connectivity and security firmware. Instead, you simply integrate the Amazon-managed hardware module and production ready ACK code into your device. Basic devices like fans and smart plugs require as little as 50 lines of code to handle Alexa directives.
Faster time to market. You can prototype using the ACK development board, sample MCU, and code, and be controlling your device using voice commands in as little as an hour. Once you’ve modeled your device’s physical features with ACK integration code, you’re ready to place production-ready ACK modules into finished devices for testing. By eliminating the requirement to build your own cloud service and mobile application, ACK enables you to get to market in months instead of years, with a smaller development team.
High-quality customer experiences. With ACK-based devices, you can take advantage of all the capabilities of the Smart Home Skill API, as well as Wi-Fi simple setup, and the Dash Replenishment Service. ACK’s managed cloud service is built on AWS IoT, and meets the cloud reliability requirements for the Works with Alexa (WWA) certification program.
Cost certainty. With ACK, you pay for the hardware module and a low, upfront fee that covers your ongoing use of the ACK cloud service. ACK enables you to turn the ongoing variable cost of managing your own cloud service into a fixed, one-time cost.
Extensibility. ACK will offer cloud extensibility points, enabling you to further enrich your customer experience. You can integrate not only with the ACK cloud service, but also with your own mobile application, your own cloud service, and third-party cloud services such as IFTTT. 

We used ACK internally to build the AmazonBasics Microwave announced today. In addition, leading device makers and consumer products companies like Procter & Gamble, Hamilton Beach, Tonly, and Midea are already using the Alexa Connect Kit to develop new devices.
“We’ve been surprised at how easy it is to use the Alexa Connect Kit to prototype devices and create Alexa commands with just a few lines of code,” said Scott Tidey, Sr. Vice President, North American Sales and Marketing, Hamilton Beach. “We look forward to using the Alexa Connect Kit to reduce time to market for new product lines while simultaneously offering more of the features our consumers want.”
 
Reach and Delight More Customers via Works with Alexa Certification
Regardless of the type of smart device you build, you can submit it for certification via the Works with Alexa (WWA) program. WWA raises the bar on responsiveness, reliability, and functionality, ensuring your customers have a great smart home experience. When your products are certified, they can carry the Works with Alexa badge in the Amazon Smart Home Store and on product packaging. This increases customer confidence that your product integrates seamlessly with Alexa. Visit the Works with Alexa program page for the full list of detailed requirements.

Introducing New Tools for Device Makers to Create Screen-Based Products with Alexa;Thu Sep 20 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Gagan Luthra;"With the Echo Show, Amazon introduced a new device category that combined the best of voice-forward experiences with a visual display. We’ve brought Alexa to even more screen-based devices in the time since, including Echo Spot and Fire tablets, and today we announced an all-new Echo Show with a beautiful 10” screen and enhanced visuals. Alongside its release, we’re excited to introduce new tools for device makers to create their own screen-based products with Alexa. These tools will be available to commercial device makers through a developer preview.
The Alexa Smart Screen and TV Device SDK is a new solution that enables device makers to create beautiful screen-based products with Alexa, combining visual experiences with standard Alexa capabilities like music, information, smart home control, and tens of thousands of Alexa skills. The SDK brings rich visual experiences to voice-forward products and includes support for visual Alexa skills developed using the new Alexa Presentation Language (APL). Device makers can bring differentiated products to market for a variety of form factors, including smart displays, ambient screens, tablets, TVs, and more. The Alexa Smart Screen and TV Device SDK is available for Android- and Linux-based devices. 
The Alexa Smart Screen and TV Device SDK for Android provides an application package that brings Echo Show-like visual experiences to tablets, TVs, and other screen-based products. It offers many of the best Alexa features right out of the box (ambient home screen, video calling and messaging, music with lyrics, video flash briefing, security camera feeds, photos, shopping, timers & alarms, weather, Q&A, to-do lists, movies & showtimes, and more) and includes support for the new APL-based visual skills. The Android variant gives device makers access to the same technology behind the next generation Echo Show, offering a faster integration path and a consistent user experience. 
The Alexa Smart Screen and TV Device SDK for Linux includes new capability agents to interface with and parse the new APL-based skills, bringing rich visual experiences to a variety of screen-based products with Alexa, including smart home devices, home appliances, smart mirrors, and more. The SDK offers a new web-based visual runtime that renders the new visual skills and interactions authored using APL. 
Commercial device makers interested in using the Alexa Smart Screen and TV Device SDK can sign-up to request an invite to the developer preview. Learn more »
We are also excited to introduce the Alexa Smart Screen Dev Kit, a hardware and software reference solution for screen-based products with Alexa built-in. Featuring a complete system design, the kit is based on a production-ready ARM Cortex-A53 chipset that hosts the Alexa client software and audio front end technology for ‘Alexa’ wake word detection. It features a 4” touch screen, a 3-mic array for far-field speech recognition, the Amazon wake word engine, and includes the new Alexa Smart Screen and TV Device SDK and a sample voice-forward GUI. In addition to support for screens with rich visuals, this dev kit features the latest AVS technologies like Alexa Multi-Room Music and Alexa communications. 
Commercial device makers can request an invite and learn more about the dev kit. Learn more » 
“Customers love placing visual, voice-enabled products at the center of their home, and these new tools will allow device makers to deliver even more choice and flexibility when it comes to visual products with Alexa,” said Pete Thompson, Vice President of Alexa Voice Service. “Because the new SDK and dev kit were built using the same core technology from the all-new Echo Show, device makers can build truly differentiated products while continuing to deliver a more consistent customer experience that includes the latest Alexa features. We can’t wait to see what they create.”
Lenovo used the Alexa Smart Screen and TV Device SDK for Android in beta to develop the Lenovo Smart Tabs, a new series of incredible Android tablets that feature Alexa built-in and Show Mode for more visual, immersive Alexa experiences. The Smart Tabs will enhance the way customers interact with their music, control smart home devices, and more.
Coming soon: Sony collaborated with Amazon to use the SDK to bring audio and visual experiences to select Sony Smart TV models that work with companion Alexa devices, like the Amazon Echo. Customers can talk to Alexa through the Echo and see visual responses on the TV for music and camera feeds.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/09/introducing-new-tools-for-device-makers-to-cr;
Deliver Whole-Home Audio with Alexa Multi-Room Music and Device Targeting;Thu Sep 20 07:00:00 UTC 2018;David Frerichs;"Customers love listening to music on devices through Alexa. In most cases, they’re asking Alexa to play music on the same device where they ask for it. In others, they want to play music in different locations at the same time, or on different devices in the same space. For example, when they say, “Alexa, play jazz in the Living Room,” they expect jazz music to start playing in the living room. “Living Room” could point to a single device or a group of devices. The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) has multiple technologies available to help device makers deliver this experience to customers: Named Device Targeting, Alexa Multi-Room Music (MRM), and proprietary cloud-controlled multi-room. The cloud-controlled solution, enabled by a Connected Speaker Skill, is for device makers that prefer to use their own proprietary multi-room synchronization protocol. Below is a simplified diagram showing how they fit together.
When the consumer says, “Alexa, play jazz in the Living Room,” the Named Device Targeting capability determines the meaning of “Living Room” and routes the play directive to a single device, cloud-controlled targets, or Alexa MRM targets as appropriate.
While there are exceptions, the technology is best summarized as follows:

For synchronized audio playback of Alexa music service provider (MSP) content between AVS devices and Amazon devices, add Alexa Multi-Room Music functionality to the AVS client.
For device makers with their own proprietary synchronization protocol to control devices without an AVS client, connect the device-maker cloud with the AVS cloud using Connected Speaker Skill.
For targeted playback on a single Alexa device, no action is needed. That functionality comes standard with Named Device Targeting.
Alexa MRM enables synchronized music playback across multiple devices. In the case above, “Living Room” is the name of an Alexa MRM virtual device group. Those devices can be any mixture of Amazon Echo branded devices and other Alexa MRM-compatible devices. Alexa MRM uses a sender and receiver model to play content. One device in the group is selected as the sender, which connects to the MSP to retrieve the content. The others are assigned as receivers and are instructed to connect to the sender and play the content in sync with it. Alexa MRM is optimized to ensure reliable playback and maintain synchronized clocks between the devices over a standard home Wi-Fi network. The distinction of Alexa MRM device group members as either senders or receivers is invisible to the consumer.
Alexa MRM clients receive their directives from AVS. Since Alexa MRM group playback uses named targeting, that playback can be initiated from consumer input on one of the member devices in an Alexa MRM group or from a separate Alexa device. For example, in “Alexa, play jazz in the Living Room”, the named target is determined to be an Alexa MRM group and Alexa Named Device Targeting routes the request to be handled by Alexa MRM. The sender is instructed via the AVS downchannel to connect to the content source. Receivers are instructed via the AVS downchannel to connect to the sender to receive the content. All members in the group then play the content in sync.
The diagram above shows Alexa MRM playback to a group of three AVS devices different from the AVS device receiving the voice command. The four devices may be include any Alexa MRM-compatible product (including Amazon Echo devices).
For devices using the AVS Device SDK, getting up and running with Alexa MRM is straightforward. Some AVS development kits have Alexa MRM built-in, so you can just download and go.

For other platforms, work with your Amazon business contact to get your platform evaluated for Alexa MRM compatibility. Once your platform is confirmed, Amazon will provide you with a pre-built Alexa MRM SDK binary, which you can integrate using the Alexa MRM patch for the AVS Device SDK. 
Music and Alexa go together naturally and Alexa MRM brings that experience to consumers across their entire home.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/09/deliver-whole-home-audio-with-alexa-multi-roo;
New Alexa Smart Home Flexible Building Block APIs;Tue Sep 18 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Mike Maas;"Editor's note: we are happy to announce that some of the updates noted below - the new Mode, Range, and Toggle capability interfaces - are now generally available in the US. Learn more. 
Today we announced two important updates to the Smart Home Skill API, available today in Preview to developers in the US, which let you extend voice control to any device—from the simplest wall plug to the most complex appliance—and to any feature of your device. First, we are adding Toggle, Range, and Mode capability interfaces, which you can use like building blocks to model the full feature set of your devices. The second update is the ability to use both custom intents and smart home directives in one skill. You no longer need to create a second custom skill when you want to add voice control for your device’s unique features or have a more conversational experience, and your customers only need to enable a single skill.
To get a first look at the Smart Home Skill API updates, check out our technical documentation.
 
Connect Any Device to Alexa with Flexible Building Block APIs
We’re adding three new capability interfaces: Alexa.ToggleController, Alexa.RangeController, and Alexa.ModeController to the Smart Home Skill API (Preview) that allow you to connect the features of any device to Alexa. You can customize these new capabilities to provide native integration for settings or features of a device that follow an on/off, numeric, or enumeration pattern. To provide fine control of your device, you can combine multiple instances of these capabilities as building blocks together with any of the dozens of existing capability interfaces like Alexa.ContactSensor. This enables you to provide voice control to anything from simple devices like plugs, to complex home appliances like washers and dryers with several toggles, multiple groups of settings, and many modes of operation. Alexa already supports the most common smart device features, such as turning on lights and locking doors; these new primitives give you the flexibility to control many more.
Alexa.ToggleController - The Alexa.ToggleController interface enables Alexa to control on/off based settings like “oscillate” on a fan, enabling/disabling the guest network of a network router, or starting/stopping a zone of a sprinkler system. By using the ToggleController interface, your customers can use on/off-based voice utterances like “Alexa, turn on child-lock on the dishwasher,” “Alexa, start the ice maker,” or “Alexa, enable auto-mode on the fan.”
Alexa.RangeController - The Alexa.RangeController interface provides an integration for numeric settings like the speed of a fan, the temperature of a shower, or other measurement values. By using the Alexa.RangeController interface, your customers can ask ""Alexa, turn up the fan speed,"" or ""Alexa, what is the temperature of the shower?""
Alexa.ModeController - The Alexa.ModeController interface provides an integration for settings that can be one of several named states or modes. These possible modes may be ordered, like low, medium, and high modes, or unordered, such as wash cycles of ""Normal"", ""Delicates"", or ""Permanent Press"". By using the Alexa.ModeController interface, your customers can use utterances such as ""Alexa, set the wash cycle to delicates.""
Declaring devices is done the same way as other capabilities interfaces such as Alexa.ColorController, Alexa.LockController, or Alexa.Speaker. With these new APIs, however, a single device can include multiple instances of Alexa.ToggleController, Alexa.RangeController, and Alexa.ModeController. This allows you to easily combine collections of settings that map the features of your device, however complicated they might be, to Alexa.
For example, a fan implementing the building block APIs could have three toggle settings with friendly names like “Auto Mode,” “Night Mode,” and “Oscillate.” This allows a customer to control each with phrases like, “Start Auto Mode,” “Turn on Night Mode,” or “Enable Oscillate.” These capabilities are defined on the device with three Alexa.ToggleControllers; one for each of the toggle settings defined.
Digging deeper, a Smart Home Discovery response describing a dishwasher appliance with multiple instances of Alexa.ToggleController capability interfaces in the capabilities array of an endpoint could look something like the following:
Toggle, Range, and Mode capabilities also support a new mechanism for specifying a list of capability friendly names, allowing you to customize what words customers can use to control their device. For example, the SampleManufacturer.Washer.Buzzer toggle instance in the previous example could have a Friendly Name of ""Buzzer"", with alternatives such as ""Beeper"" or ""Alarm"". This enables customers to more easily discover and naturally use this toggle by giving them additional names for the buzzer.
The Range and Mode capabilities allow further customization of names, with Range allowing named ""presets"" corresponding to particular numeric values, and Mode allowing named ""modes.” For example, an electric tea kettle with various temperature set points might provide aliases for each type of tea that should steep at a particular temperature so customers could say “Alexa, set the tea kettle to 212 degrees Fahrenheit,” or simply “Alexa, set the tea kettle to boiling.” In this example, the value of the Range of 212 F and “boiling” represent the same Range value. If we look at the Smart Home Discovery response for a device that specifies might specify natural aliases for an Alexa.RangeController we could see a collection of capability presets that looks like the following:
For names of your device features or settings, you will also be able to take advantage of catalogs of pre-defined terms that are automatically localized to new regions. For terms that are specific to your devices or brand, you can provide translations in each language you support and Alexa will take care of choosing the right language.
Any functionality modeled using Toggle, Range, and Mode is available for customers to use as part of an Alexa Routine as well. For example, say “Alexa, good morning,” and your shower automatically turns to the customer’s pre-defined settings. Or “Alexa, good night,” and the fan turns down to night mode as the lights blink out. When you model your devices’ features with the native smart home device capabilities, Alexa knows how to make your devices work together to create a smarter, more comfortable, and productive home. The Alexa.ToggleController, Alexa.RangeController, and Alexa.ModeController capability interfaces make it even easier for you to let Alexa to control any smart home device.
For more technical information, see Connect Any Device to Alexa, the Alexa Skills Kit Capability Interface Message Guide, and the device templates documentation.
 
Use Multiple Skill Types in a Single Alexa Skill
Customers no longer need to search for and enable multiple skills to access all the features of their Alexa-connected device. Having to enable multiple skills also meant that you would have to configure and maintain separate skills for custom and smart home functionality. Now, you can publish and maintain a single skill that enables both the smart home and custom features of your device. This reduces effort for you and simplifies the customer experience.
Implementing multiple skill types in a single skill involves adding an additional model to a base skill either from the Alexa Developer Console, through SMAPI directly, or via the Alexa Skills Kit Command-Line Interface (ASK CLI) and updating your skill logic to handle requests from those models. You can also update existing skills through the Alexa Developer Console.
For example, adding multiple models from the Alexa Developer Console is simply part of the skill configuration workflow.
After adding a model to your skill, you will need to properly handle the functionality of the model in your skill logic in the same way you would previously handle custom, video, or smart home requests in separate skills.
For example, if you have an existing skill that uses a smart home model and you would like to update it to use a custom model, you would also need to add skill logic to handle the session requests from the custom interaction model either manually or with one of the Alexa Skill Kit Software Development Kits (SDKs) for Node.js, Java, or Python. In practical terms, this means evaluating the incoming request and responding appropriately to incoming custom session or smart home directive requests.
If you build a skill that combines video with smart home or custom skills, you will need to start the skill configuration workflow with the video skill. This is because the first run experience of a video skill requires users to associate a service provider with an AV device.
For more information on using multiple models in your skills, see Create Skills that Combine Models and the Alexa.CustomIntent Interface for declaring custom intents during device discovery.
The new updates are backwards-compatible and will be available later this year. To get a first look at the Smart Home Skill API updates, check out our technical documentation. To begin development using these new capabilities, apply to join the Smart Home Skill API (Preview).

Introducing the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit: Create Fun and Delightful Echo-Connected Accessories;Tue Sep 18 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Caroline Pan;"We’re excited to announce the availability of the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit (Beta), allowing you to build your very own Alexa Gadgets — fun and delightful accessories that pair to compatible Echo devices via Bluetooth. Alexa Gadgets extend Alexa’s capabilities to new modalities with motors, lights, sound chips, and more.
With the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit, you can build on what customers already love about Alexa, whether it’s responding with requested information from across the room, setting reminders, or playing music. Now, you can extend these same capabilities to gadget devices, and manifest customer interactions with Alexa in a variety of physical forms. For example, create a disco ball that sparkles the room with light when a customer asks Alexa a question, or a robot that lip syncs to things Alexa says. The possibilities for designing customer enjoyment are infinite. Early adopters including Hasbro, WowWee Group Limited, Gemmy Industries, Baby Plus®, TOMY International, Novalia, and eKids (an affiliate of iHome), are already working to deliver customer entertainment using the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit.
The Alexa Gadgets Toolkit offers self-service APIs, including Gadget Interfaces that expose metadata of Alexa’s capabilities on compatible Echo devices. It also includes technical documentation and sample code that facilitate direct pairing and connectivity, communication, and over-the-air (OTA) updates between your gadget and its paired Echo device. Start building today without requiring advanced processors, microphone and audio processing, or device cloud management.
With the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit and technical documentation, you can build an Alexa Gadget that uses one or more of our list of Gadget Interfaces. The list of available interfaces will continue to grow, but for now, here are a few ideas to get you started:

Wake Word Detection: Respond when the wake word is detected, such as a cuckoo clock that pops its head out whenever a customer says, “Alexa”
Speech: Sync movement to text-to-speech, such as a robot that lip syncs as Alexa reads the local weather report
Notifications: Respond to notifications, such as a flag that raises each time a notification is received
Timers: Respond when a timer has expired, such as an outdoor gong that chimes when backyard playtime timer has concluded
Alarms: Respond when an alarm has been triggered, such as a switch that releases dog food each time an alarm has expired
Reminders: Respond when a pre-set reminder has gone off, such as a pill box that plays a short tune and flashes an array of colors when it’s time for daily vitamins
Music (Coming Soon): Create visual performances with music, such as a hula girl that sways her hips when songs are playing on Amazon Music

The first products to take advantage of the Alexa Gadgets Toolkit will be available to consumers later this year, including a variety of dancing plush animatronics and an updated Big Mouth Billy Bass from Gemmy Industries. Each uses the available Gadget Interfaces to deliver amusing reactions as customers interact with Alexa.

Now It's Easier to Test Your Echo Buttons Skills to Deliver Fun Experiences;Tue Sep 18 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Nate Schulz;"Editors' Note: The Gadgets Skill API is now the Echo Buttons Skill API. The interface names and underlying functionality are unchanged.
ou can now test your Alexa skills for Echo Buttons without owning an Echo device or Echo Buttons by using the Alexa simulator in the Alexa Developer Console. The simulator enables you to focus on delivering fun experiences for Echo Buttons using audio, text, and button input. Use the simulator to debug JSON requests and responses and to test template rendering, multi-turn conversations, entity resolution, dialog management, and more. Echo Buttons customers are always looking for great games to play with their friends and family and we're making it easier for you to make the next great skill they will love.
 
New Capabilities for Echo Buttons Skill Testing
Starting today, if your Alexa skill uses the GadgetController or GameEngine custom skill interfaces you will be presented with four simulated Echo Buttons when you test your skill using the Test tab in the Alexa Developer Console. You can use these buttons just as you would a pack of physical Echo Buttons; simply click on the buttons to send button events to your skill and display your light animations on each of the buttons during the skill session.
Gadget Events in the Device Logs
Since the Echo Buttons are integrated into the simulator environment, you will be able to see additional information in the existing Device Log output. You can use these logs to reconcile with events that your skill receives and logs.
In this example below, we launched the Quick Colors skill to test the launch request and roll call features.

Due to the natural difference between the RGB LEDs in the Echo Buttons and colors rendered in a web browser, the color represented in the simulator may not match the color rendered on the Echo Buttons. For best results, we recommend testing colors on physical Echo Buttons hardware prior to publishing your skill.
Visualize Directives in Skill I/O Output
The Skill I/O panel can be insightful when debugging or testing a skill. This continues to be true for Echo Buttons skills. You’ll be able to see your skill’s directives, including gadget directives, in its response. Please note that Skill I/O may only be available for simulated voice requests and launch requests.
Start Testing Your Echo Buttons Skills Today

Log into the Alexa Developer Console, select the skill you want to test, and then click the “Test” tab.
Turn on the Echo Buttons simulator widget from the options section above “Skill I/O.” Four simulated Echo Buttons will appear below the options menu.
Launch your Echo Buttons skill using the Alexa Simulator tab in the left navigation pane by either clicking and holding the microphone button or by typing “open [skill invocation name]” in the text input field.
You can switch between voice or text input at will as you progress through your skill session.

Echo Buttons support in the Alexa simulator is currently in public beta in the US, the UK, and Germany while development continues. For the best experience, we recommend using the latest version of Google Chrome. The Alexa simulator also works in the latest versions of Firefox and Apple's Safari. Be sure to leave us feedback in the Alexa Gadgets Developer Forum.

We're excited to bring these improvements to Echo Buttons Skill Developers, and we hope you find this addition to the Alexa simulator useful. We look forward to seeing the experiences that you create for Echo Buttons!";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/09/ow-it-s-easier-to-test-your-echo-buttons-skills-to-deliver-fun-gaming-experiences;
Sizing Up CPU, Memory, and Storage for Your Alexa Built-in Device;Thu Sep 13 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Bob Mars;"Alexa offers your customers a new way to interface with technology – a convenient UI that enables them to plan their day, stream media, and access news and information. If you’re planning on building a device with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS), you’ll want to ensure you have the right amount of central processing unit (CPU) power, memory, and flash storage to ensure your product brings a delightful hands-free Alexa experience to your customers.
In this blog post, we provide examples of existing AVS device solutions that can be used as a guide for sizing up CPU, memory, and storage for a headless voice-forward device with microphone(s) and speaker(s). Please note this blog does not cover CPU or memory requirements for screen-based devices, tap-to-talk Alexa implementations, smart home use cases or Alexa Calling and Messaging.
Sizing an embedded system processor is a combination of science and art. A common but outdated convention is to use Dhrystone MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second), or DMIPS, as a measure of processor performance relative to the 1970-era DEC VAX 11/780 minicomputer. DMIPS are generally reported as DMIPS/MHz for the typical MIPS of a processor at a given MHz. The Dhrystone benchmark suffers from several shortcomings, as performance metrics can vary considerably for the same hardware using different compilers, compiler optimization settings that optimize away large portions of the test code, and wait-state delays for reading from memory. Other benchmarks suffer similarly. At the end of the day, your real-world application is the final judge of actual performance.
An Alexa client application requires host processor cycles for tasks such as wake word detection, data compression and decompression. It also requires memory to buffer outbound and inbound audio streams for Text-To-Speech (TTS) and music playback. Compiler options for code size optimization and techniques for code compaction to generate smaller executables that more easily fit in limited amounts of memory on embedded systems are commonly used to keep costs to a minimum. These constraints impose a need for considering both CPU and memory when developing and optimizing embedded systems software.
Programming styles on large versus small computer systems can also vary and affect required processing power and memory. The adage that compute cycles are cheaper than human programming cycles as it generally applies to large computer systems does not necessarily translate well to small embedded systems. While it’s true that System on Chip (SoC) or System On Module (SOM) capabilities continue to increase and lower in cost, competitive markets and tight margins impose a need for close scrutiny of the overall cost of the system, especially when millions are being produced. Techniques such as code profiling help isolate portions of programs that utilize more CPU or memory. Focusing optimization in these areas is a first step in reducing the overhead of software components and ultimately enable a lower cost hardware solution.
Software component overhead is often reported in DMIPS, which we’ve already seen can be problematic. Generally, overhead is calculated by the sum of all components believed to contribute. The challenge lies in knowing all of the contributors. Another challenge is knowing whether other components running on the system, some periodic, were also considered. Software involving complex and unpredictable interactions make this even more challenging.
Headroom provides a measurement of what’s left, given all else. Measuring the headroom of unused processor cycles, memory, and storage accounts for all components running on the system. Also, by starting with the AVS Device SDK sample application (SampleApp) and measuring the associated headroom, you’ll be able to determine how much is left for your application’s features and customizations. Available tools on Linux for measuring CPU, memory, and storage include top, df, and inspection of /proc/meminfo. Be sure to subtract out the CPU and memory usage of top itself when using it.
The amount of CPU, memory, and storage can vary substantially for different processor architectures and operating systems. Optimization techniques play a huge role in reducing required system resource capacity. Table 1 below shows examples of processor, memory, and flash storage headroom values in Alexa applications for Alexa conversation (voice responses, Flash Briefings, weather) and streaming media use cases. The vendor column indicates whether the device originates with a processor vendor (V), AVS Systems Integrator (SI), or an AVS Development Kit (Dev Kit).
Each solution has varying degrees of optimization as illustrated in the Level of Optimization (LoO) column. It also shows an example of a very optimized solution on a considerably less powerful ARM Cortex-R4 microcontroller for illustration purposes, but where the Alexa wake word engine runs exclusively on the digital signal processor front-end of the device to offload the host processor.

Table 2 and Figure 1 below illustrate how effectively the various solutions utilize the host processor and memory.
The data for each of the processors were normalized to a common frequency of 1GHz MCPS and 512MB RAM for comparison. A gain multiplier was introduced to factor in a hypothetical gain that could be achieved by exchanging machine cycles for larger RAM utilization. The low-end ARM Cortex-R4 was left out to limit the comparison to solutions that implement the Alexa wake word on the host processor.
The data demonstrates that solutions provided by AVS Systems Integrators generally make the most effective use of system resources on the device, thereby enabling a lower cost solution and lowering mass production costs. Note that the data may vary over time and are only a snapshot of present Systems Integrators performance. Working with Systems Integrators also provides the benfits of acoustic expertise, Audio Front-End (AFE), pre-validation and manufacturing testing support, OTA updates for new features and security, as well as peace of mind know you’ll have a device that passes the high-quality bar.
If you plan on rolling out your own device with Alexa built-in and have the needed inhouse expertise and resources, please review the provided LoO data to determine the solution architecture that best fits your product’s needs and the capabilities of your developer resources. Be sure to leave a 20%+ margin in available CPU after considering the Alexa client and your product’s software to incorporate future Alexa features and functionality. For Cortex-A7 and more powerful processors, be sure to use at least 512 MB of flash for more robust Over-The-Air (OTA) updates as the extra storage will allow for an active and inactive set of partitions with safe fallback in the event of an incomplete update.
Cost and the need for low-power voice-forward consumer devices are the driving forces for using lower-powered processors and less memory. However, this must be balanced with time-to-market and a capability for supporting new Alexa features, especially for the initial first release of a novel product. Users have an expectation for feature parity across voice-forward devices. The good news is that working with Systems Integrators can get your product to market faster and lower the overall cost with a more effective solution.
AVS makes it easy to integrate Alexa directly into your products and bring voice-forward experiences to customers. Through AVS, you can add a new natural user interface to your products and offer your customers access to a growing number of Alexa features, smart home integrations, and skills. Get started with AVS.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/09/cpu-memory-and-storage-for-alexa-built-in-dev;
Alexa, It's Bedtime!

Announcing Contact and Motion Sensor APIs and Integration into Alexa Routines, Unlocking New Customer Scenarios in Home Automation, Monitoring, and Control;Tue Aug 28 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Brian Crum;"We’re excited to announce that contact and motion sensors can now be connected to Alexa, and that updates from sensors can now activate Alexa Routines, unlocking new customer scenarios in home automation, monitoring, and control. Customers can connect contact and motion sensors to Alexa in two ways: either through a smart home skill that uses the new Contact and Motion Sensor APIs, or with a compatible Zigbee sensor paired directly to Echo Plus or a compatible smart home hub. And starting today, SmartThings customers can use the sensors connected to their SmartThings hub with Alexa by enabling the SmartThings skill. So now, with the appropriately configured smart home skill or connected Zigbee sensor, a customer can ask, ""Alexa, is the master bedroom window open?"" and Alexa will respond with its status.
 
Contact and Motion Sensor Customer Use Cases
Customers can view their connected sensors in the Alexa App, query their status by asking Alexa, and use sensors to activate Routines to control other connected smart home devices, say special phrases, play music, receive notifications, and much more. Customers can use their sensors to automate a wide variety of custom-built Routines, such as:

When motion is detected in the living room, Alexa can turn on the lights, and then turn off the lights after 30 minutes with no motion detected
A motion sensor within a Wi-Fi camera can turn on a light and send a notification to your phone
You can ask Alexa if a door or window is open before arming the home security system
A front door contact sensor can activate Alexa to announce that the front door is open
A pantry door contact sensor can turn the pantry lights on and off when the door opens and closes
 

Contact and Motion Sensors Compatible with Alexa Today
By updating your smart home skill to use the new Contact and Motion Sensor APIs, you can enable your customers to connect their contact and motion sensors to Alexa. These new additions to the Smart Home Skill API are available in the US today, with support for additonal locales coming soon. SmartThings is leveraging these new smart home capabilities so customers can use their SmartThings multi-purpose sensor and SmartThings motion sensor, connected to a SmartThings hub, with Alexa Routines and voice query.
Customers with an Echo Plus can already use its built-in smart home hub to seamlessly connect and control compatible Zigbee devices, such as light bulbs, door locks, in-wall switches, and plugs, without the need for a separate hub or a smart home skill. Now, Echo Plus can connect to compatible Zigbee contact and motion sensors including contact and motion sensors from Centralite, and contact and motion sensors from Sylvania, with support from SmartThings sensors coming soon.
 
Integrating New Contact and Motion Sensor Capabilities
For Zigbee device makers, you can deliver an improved experience and reach more customers by integrating with Alexa and certifying your Zigbee devices through the Works with Alexa (WWA) Certification Program. In order to ensure compatibility with Echo Plus, Zigbee sensors must report as a contact or motion sensor and use the Home Automation 1.2 Zigbee standard.
For hub manufacturers and non-ZigBee sensor manufacturers, you can integrate your sensors with Alexa via a smart home skill that uses the new Contact and Motion Sensor APIs. This enables richer customer experiences and new interactions that extend the value of your devices and services by connecting them to Alexa’s voice user interface (VUI) and to the many devices certified to Work with Alexa. It is important to note that contact and motion sensors connected via an Alexa skill must support Proactive State Updates (PSU) in order to activate Alexa Routines. If you are a device maker with a smart home skill and you have not yet implemented PSU, learn how you can migrate your Alexa skill to the updated Smart Home Skill API. 
 
Reach and Delight More Customers
Whether you build contact and motion sensors or other smart devices that connect to Alexa, you can submit your products for certification via the Works with Alexa (WWA) Certification Program. The program raises the bar on responsiveness, reliability, and functionality, ensuring your customers have the best smart home experiences. When your devices are certified, they can carry the WWA badge in the Amazon Smart Home Store and on product packaging, increasing customer confidence that your devices integrate seamlessly with Alexa.

Access Device Change Reports with Test Simulator Live Debugging for Smart Home Devices (Beta);Thu Aug 16 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Mike Maas;"Today we are excited to announce live debugging for smart home devices (beta). With this new functionality, you can now view device change reports sent to Alexa and examine their content for errors and reliability.
For developers building skills for smart home devices, the live debugging feature in the Alexa Developer Console provides visibility to change reports and any processing errors encountered with them in near real time. Access the new debugging tool, in addition to other testing and validation features, from the Alexa Simulator panel of the developer console. You’ll also find enhanced documentation showing different change report errors and how to handle them.
Using this tool, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of submitted change reports. Device change report integrity is critical in building the right experience for customers and supporting the accuracy of smart home features. By enabling you to publish accurate change reports to Alexa, you ultimately provide customers with improved functionality and experiences on their smart home devices.
 
How to Use Live Debugging for Smart Home Devices (Beta)
Enabling the ‘Alexa Smart Home (Beta)’ checkbox, shown below, displays a smart home widget where developers can turn on live debugging.
Once live debugging is enabled, change reports for devices associated with the developer account will automatically appear in the Device Log panel. Change reports are displayed as the actual JSON payload and include device details, what was changed, the previous state of the device, and any processing errors encountered. As device changes continue to occur, new change reports appear in the Device Log, allowing you to get insights into change report behaviors so you can make appropriate corrections as errors are identified.
Below is an example of a device log entry for a successful change report:
With the new live debugging tool, you can debug issues with change reports and view the actual JSON payload received by Alexa. The new tool also provides clear error codes and messages related to processing the change report.
Live debugging is accessible to all developers building a skill using smart home APIs. Once enabled, change reports for devices associated with the developer’s account will automatically appear. If you are creating skills for smart home devices and would benefit from live debugging, review the documentation and join the community in the Alexa Smart Home Skill Developer Forum.

Enable Customers to Access Recorded Video Feeds with Alexa via the Cameras Recap API;Tue Aug 07 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Brian Crum;"Today, we are excited to announce the addition of the Cameras Recap API to the Smart Home Skill API so that your smart home camera skill can enable customers to view recorded smart home camera video feeds on Echo Show, Echo Spot, Fire TV, and Fire Tablets. Once you’ve implemented the new Cameras Recap API, customers can say, “Alexa, show the event that just happened at the front door” and see the last recorded event from their connected camera. Support for the Cameras Recap API is available today from Ring, Arlo, Cloud Cam, and August. This new capability is available today to developers in the US with support for additional international locales coming soon.
How to Use the Cameras Recap API
To use the new Cameras Recap API, you must use version 3 (V3) of the Smart Home Skill API. The Cameras Recap API implements the authentication model in V3 of the Smart Home Skill API, which enables your skill to send events to Alexa asynchronously. When your smart home skill receives a camera stream request, you respond with an URL to the requested video feed. Depending on your storage and subscription policies, the recorded video feed is made available your customer.
To support this functionality, there is one new directive and two events related to cameras:

If the camera supports Media Creation, then it should be declared during discovery with this new capability set as ""Alexa.MediaMetadata”. When a customer requests a video feed then an URI will be requested via MediaMetadata: GetMediaMetadata. 
Use the MediaCreatedOrUpdated Event to indicate when there is motion, audio, a doorbell press, or when a live view being recorded. 
When a video is deleted, send an event using MediaDeleted Event.

In addition, there are some security and performance requirements for the smart home camera feeds. Review the requirements for smart home cameras before starting your implementation.

ESP Moves to the Cloud for all Alexa-Enabled Devices;Wed Jul 25 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Brendon Wilson;"There are millions of customers with more than one Alexa-enabled device in their home, and for these customers one of the most important features we’ve built is Echo Spatial Perception (ESP). The ESP feature provides a frustration-free experience by identifying the best device to respond when interacting with Alexa in a multi-device environment. The technology determines which device is closest to the customer, and helps Alexa respond through that device.
ESP was first introduced to the Echo family of devices. As the number of Alexa-enabled devices grew, we began to expand the feature to third-party device makers. Prior implementations of ESP required device integration with additional software, and the feature wasn’t implemented on every Alexa-enabled device.
Today we’re announcing that ESP has moved to the cloud, introducing several benefits to developers. With Cloud ESP, all existing and new Alexa-enabled devices get the ESP feature with no requirement for device-side software changes. Cloud ESP also offers superior accuracy – even in noisy environments – and because Alexa is always getting smarter, the feature will continue to improve over time. 
“Alexa continues to become increasingly integrated with people’s lives as she is enabled across more devices from a range of manufacturers,” said Priya Abani, director of Amazon Alexa. “By automatically enabling all devices to take advantage of ESP, customers are given the best experience with Alexa across the growing number of devices and Alexa-enabled experiences.”
Alexa continues to expand to new countries, regions, and device types. As the number of Alexa-enabled devices grows, customers will increasingly bring these voice-forward products into their homes. ESP ensures that customers enjoy their Alexa experience from the very first utterance.
AVS makes it easy to integrate Alexa directly into your products and bring voice-forward experiences to customers. Through AVS, you can add a new natural user interface to your products and offer your customers access to a growing number of Alexa features, smart home integrations, and skills. Get Started.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/07/esp-moves-to-the-cloud-for-alexa-enabled-devi;
Alexa, Crank Up the Bass! Announcing Equalizer and Sound Mode Controls for Smart Home Entertainment Devices;Mon Jul 23 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Mike Maas;"Today we are excited to announce equalizer (EQ) and sound mode controls for smart home entertainment devices, available today for customers in the US across the Amazon Echo family of devices, and on select Alexa-enabled devices built using the Alexa Voice Service (AVS). Now customers can personalize the tone of the audio playing on their speakers, AV receivers, and sound bars by simply saying, “Alexa, crank up the bass,” “Alexa, turn up treble,” or “Alexa, set TV mode.”

For developers working with entertainment devices and audio-visual playback, the equalizer and sound mode control features extend the capabilities of voice control with Alexa and are available today through the Smart Home Skill API and AVS API.  Integrated equalizer control will be available soon through the AVS SDK, but select Alexa-enabled devices have already been introduced with these new capabilities: Sound United implemented band and mode control into the recently launched Polk Command Bar, and Sonos incorporated mode control into its newest soundbar, Sonos Beam.

“Consumers want simplicity and performance from their audio products. By adding the EQ API and Alexa Voice Service (AVS) to the Polk Command Bar, our consumers can control sound bar functions like setting or changing sound modes (e.g. Movie, Music, Night and Sport), bass volume and volume levels with just their voice. It also simplifies the installation and setup process and makes the value proposition of the Polk Command Bar stronger than before.” Michael Greco, Brand Director for Polk Audio.

Some more examples of how customers might use these new capabilities include:

“Alexa, increase bass.”
""Alexa, increase bass in living room.""
“Alexa, set movie mode.”
""Alexa, set night mode on bedroom TV.""
""Alexa, set bass to three on sound bar.”
“Alexa, decrease treble.""
The new equalizer functionality in the Smart Home API (Version 3) and the AVS API responds to three initial bands and a collection of supported modes, through four new directives in the Alexa.EqualizerController for Smart Home and EqualizerController interface for AVS.
Bands define audio frequency ranges. Customers can refer to these bands by name to strengthen or weaken low-to-high audio frequencies. Today, the supported band names are: Bass, Midrange, and Treble. In general, bands allow customers to fine-tune their audio per device to achieve an equalized output suitable to their environment or tastes. You can specify a numeric range for the bands you support in the discovery/capability response (See “How to enable Equalizer Control” section below for details).
Modes represent equalizer presets for playback of a type of music or environment. Today, the supported modes are: MOVIE, MUSIC, NIGHT, SPORT, TV.
Alexa.EqualizerController and the EqualizerController interface expose four directives for equalizer adjustment: SetBands, AdjustBands, ResetBands and SetMode directives. This interface is intended for devices that can set and adjust equalizer bands or modes based on ranges defined by the device manufacturer.
Depending on your implementation, you'll enable EqualizerController with Alexa.Discovery or the Capabilities API.
To add the equalizer and sound mode functionality to your device skill, the first change to consider is how your device discovery information is presented to Alexa.

The capability section of an endpoint for a Discover.Response that implements both bands and modes would look like the following:
The configuration field represent the different equalizer bands and modes supported by the endpoint. Other than a new interface and its relevant schema, the general discovery format remains the same as before with version 3 of the Smart Home Skill API. For more information, review the discovery documentation for entertainment devices.
To enable EqualizerController for an AVS product, you must declare the interface in your call to the Capabilities API. This is a sample that presumes all AVS interfaces are enabled:
After a successful call to the Capabilities API, directives in the EqualizerController namespace will be sent to your product. For additional details, review the Capabilities API specification.

If you are building devices that could benefit from EQ and sound mode control, please review the documentation and join the community in the Alexa Smart Home Skill Developer Forum or the Alexa Voice Service Developer Forum. We look forward to seeing what you create with these new capabilities.

How to Create a Self-Test Room and Evaluate Your Alexa Voice Service Integration;Tue Jul 17 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Dave Berol;"Alexa offers your customers a new way to interface with technology – a convenient UI that enables them to plan their day, control their smart home devices, and access news and information. If you’re already building a voice-forward product with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS), you’ll want to ensure you have the right setup to effectively test your integration prior to launch. Testing your Alexa-enabled product in a variety of scenarios will help ensure that you bring a delightful hands-free Alexa experience to your customers and encourage habitual usage of Alexa capabilities.
We recommend a two-phased approach to test your integration: self-tests and then product submission to Amazon. During self-tests, you will complete a series of exercises to ensure your product meets functional and user experience (UX) requirements. If you’re building a far-field device or want to enable certain domains like music, you’ll also want to execute additional testing prior to launch. Before you start, make sure your integration adheres to our Functional Requirements, review our UX Guidelines, and set up your self-test environment.
In this blog post, we’ll cover the minimum requirements for a self-test room that you can construct at your workplace.
Our experience has helped us hone in on some standard characteristics that make a self-test room effective for voice performance evaluation. The room requirements are similar to those defined by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), with some customization. Specifically, we are leveraging ETSI EG 202 396-1 V1.2.2, Section 6.1. Best of all, our recommendation doesn’t require you to build a specific type of room – you can enable self-testing in a typical office room. These are the minimum requirements:
We recommend a room at least 2.5 m x 3.5 m x 2.2 m. These dimensions are in reference to usable space.
Look for a room with wall-to-wall carpet and some acoustical damping (ceiling tiles) in the ceiling. If the room has a lot of windows or a large whiteboard, consider covering these with a set of curtains to avoid strong reflections by hard surfaces. We target a reverberation time that is less than 0.7 s and higher than 0.2 s. This is targeted for the frequency range captured by Alexa, between 100 Hz and 8 kHz. For technical specifics we defer to ISO 3382-3:2012. If you are building a test chamber, please consider 10 Hz neoprene isolators and bass trap panels in the corners.
To reduce the influence of unwanted noise on your results, the background noise of your test room should be less than 35 dBA.
Your setup requires 1 noise speaker, 4 speech speakers, your device under test and at least a 0.5 m clearance between the walls, test speakers, and your device. To control the output of the speech speakers and noise speaker you will want to get a multi-channel sound card, such as the Roland Octa-Capture or RME Fireface.
The above image shows the placement and angles to complete testing. After you’ve completed the self-test room set up, you can evaluate your Alexa integration, and correct bugs uncovered during the process. For access to Amazon self-tests and the audio files required for testing, reach out to your Amazon point-of-contact or follow the instructions for how to launch with AVS. Refer to our Product Testing overview for more information on self-tests and how to submit your device for additional Amazon review.

4 Ways to Increase Visibility and Drive Sales of Your Alexa-Enabled Product on Amazon.com;Wed May 23 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Ted Karczewski;"Voice user interface (VUI) design is catching on fast with customers and we want to make it easier for you to build with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) and launch your Alexa-enabled device. Today, we’re going to focus on the launch and marketing aspect of bringing a new voice-forward product to market.
You have asked for more guidance on how to promote and increase the visibility of your Alexa-enabled product on Amazon.com. We recently published a new Marketing Opportunities resource that walks through the ways to implement your marketing strategy on Amazon.com. Below we provide an overview of these programs, their benefits, and how to quickly get started.
Not yet selling on Amazon.com? Create a Seller Account to begin selling your Alexa-enabled product to Amazon customers.
Amazon offers numerous ways to increase your Alexa-enabled product’s exposure to the millions of customers who shop on Amazon.com every day. Here are four programs we highly recommend to ensure a successful launch of your Alexa-enabled product:
Think of your Amazon.com detail page as your digital retail associate. We’ve all walked into a store before only to be greeted by subpar customer service. These experiences make it harder for customers to feel confident in the brand or their purchases. You want your page to provide a great customer experience, show off the core features of your product, and answer any questions your customers may have. A+ detail content is a simple way to up-level your presence on Amazon.com, giving you the opportunity to differentiate your product detail page, showcase all your Alexa-enabled product has to offer, and add multimedia content. Best of all, A+ detail pages have shown to increase sales by an average of 11%.
Star ratings and customer reviews play a pivotal role in instilling greater confidence in customers’ purchasing decisions. Reviews can also help drive offline sales given that many customers use Amazon in researching purchases. Amazon Vine allows you to seed your Alexa-enabled product to trusted Amazon reviewers prior to your product’s launch. Customers will test out your device and provide well-written, detailed reviews of your product, which will launch on Amazon.com once the product is available for sale. Make sure you enroll in Vine 35 to 45 days before launch to ensure you generate enough trusted reviews to move the needle. Customers have indicated that they find Vine reviews helpful 76% of the time, higher than for non-Vine reviews.

Publishing Your Product's Capabilities to Alexa;Thu Apr 19 07:00:00 UTC 2018;Dylan Miller;"Today we’re excited to announce the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Capabilities API. As Alexa gets smarter with new features and updates that require client-side code changes, you can use the Capabilities API to let Alexa know which interfaces and interface versions your product supports following an over-the-air (OTA) update.
For example, after your product installs an OTA update that adds support for a new Alexa feature, you publish your product's new capabilities to Alexa by specifying the interfaces and interface versions your product supports using the Capabilities API. Alexa will only enable a new feature on products that have successfully installed your OTA update and are ready to support the new feature, leaving products that have not yet updated, unchanged.
We are also introducing interface versioning, which enables you to clearly understand changes made to the APIs as new features are added or updated, and communicate those versions to Alexa using the Capabilities API.
Note: If you are using the AVS Device SDK v1.7 or later, no further action is required.
When new directives and events are added to or removed from an interface, or when message payloads are adjusted, impacted interfaces will be versioned independently using a MAJOR.MINOR scheme.
The MAJOR number for an interface version is increased when incompatibilities are introduced.
The MINOR number for an interface version is increased for backward compatible, non-breaking changes.
For more details on interface versioning and for a list of current and supported interface versions, please see the Capabilities API documentation on the AVS Developer Portal.
Capabilities is a new HTTP1.1 API that you must call when your product is first unboxed or when the firmware on your product changes to support new Alexa features. When you call the API, you must provide the complete list of interfaces and interface versions that your product supports.
Please see the Capabilities API documentation for a more detailed discussion of the API and a complete set of use cases.
The AVS Device SDK v1.7 and later supports the Capabilities API and interface versioning. Build your first prototype with Raspberry Pi or download the latest code to see the new features. Prototype with the updated AVS Device SDK for C++ Client for Raspberry Pi now.

Karen Wickert’s background as a mechanical engineer has led to some unique opportunities. After being exposed to software testing in a previous job, Wickert took a role at Sonos as a software test engineer and is now a software test manager.
Wickert’s unique involvement with Alexa at Sonos shows voice offers far more opportunities than just being a developer. Wickert encourages women to search out companies willing to uphold them, and then share their stories to inspire others to do the same.
“Yes, it can be a hard road,” says Wickert. “But just imagine the experience you can have if you open yourself to all of the possibilities that voice enables. How can you not want to be a part of that?""

Developers around the world are building rich voice experiences with the Alexa Skills Kit and Alexa Voice Service. Help shape the UI of the future and enable customers to engage via voice. Build skills to make Alexa smarter using the Alexa Skills Kit, and integrate Alexa into your product with the Alexa Voice Service.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/03/women-of-voice-meet-9-women-shaping-the-futur;
Sonos’ Karen Wickert: Proof That Testing Is Critical When Building Alexa-Enabled Products;Wed Mar 07 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Jennifer King;"When Karen Wickert started their career as a mechanical engineer, they never imagined they’d end up building devices with cutting-edge voice technology like Alexa.
“One day my boss asked if I could help test a software project, and right away that just clicked for me,” says Wickert. “I immediately started my transition toward software testing, and I haven’t ever looked back.”
After convincing their employer to give them similar testing roles over 18 months, Wickert eventually joined Sonos as a software test engineer and now serves as a Software Test Manager. Wickert is a powerful force behind the quality of the Sonos One smart speaker, built using the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) Device SDK which enables device makers to integrate Alexa directly into their products.
“I just like the possibilities voice brings,” says Wickert. “It opens my creative brain in a way I really love, thinking about how this technology can be used now, and how it will be used in the future.”
Wickert didn’t become a software test manager overnight. Other than taking a couple of software courses at university, Wickert was convinced their path would remain in mechanical engineering, not necessarily programming.
Their passion for software began when a project lead asked if they had time to help out testing some Python code. Wickert developed a knack for taking a piece of software and running it through the wringer to ensure the team delivered the highest quality product possible in the time available. That skill led to Sonos hiring Wickert as a test engineer in 2015.
“Our main goal is to really polish our home sound systems to make sure customers have the best possible experience,” says Wickert. “That means we have to shake out as many issues as quickly as possible, to make sure it’s not going to break in unexpected ways.”
Wickert holds open the possibility of going into software development someday. But for now Wickert is loving the “whole-system touch” they get with testing, not to mention having an outlet for creative thinking and troubleshooting.
“As a software tester, I get to interact with all aspects of a product during the test phases: hardware, software, beta testers, customer care, cloud software, firmware, DevOps—you name it,” says Wickert. “There are very few days I don’t learn something new.”
When Wickert first started at Sonos, they focused on testing Sonos speakers and the accompanying web and smartphone apps. These let users access and play music from a variety of streaming services across any number of Sonos devices. However, the company saw the rapid adoption of Alexa and decided to embrace it as a new way of interacting with its customers.
“There's something about voice interaction you can't get with a smartphone,” says Wickert. “It's easier, more interactive, more intuitive. I can be cooking in my kitchen and ask Alexa to play NPR news or whatever I feel like, without even slowing down.""
Their first voice-related testing was with the Sonos smart home skill, which allowed users to control their Sonos speakers using any Alexa-enabled device. More recently, their focus has shifted to the new Sonos One, a smart speaker with Alexa built-in.
“With Alexa built right into our speakers, it’s a lot easier to control everything around you, with a lot more interactivity,” says Wickert. “People love using their speakers for playing games with their kids, checking the weather or controlling their lights. I love that it’s not just about music anymore.”
Verifying all the extra functionality means Wickert stays busy. On a typical day, they’ll set up Alexa-enabled Sonos One speakers in the lab, configure them, execute a few test plans, work through a defect list, verify developer’s fixes—and that’s just before lunchtime.
“Our developers are fantastic, but the fact is, you're going to have bugs no matter how well-audited you are,” says Wickert. “My goal is to minimize those defects by the time we go to market, so customers will be completely thrilled with their experience.”
Wickert says it’s astonishing how far voice technology has come in such a short time.  
“Yet we’re just scratching the surface of what we can do with this technology,” says Wickert. “What’s great is this experience is making developers and testers alike more agile, more willing to take risks, and more willing to challenge the status quo.”
That status quo, according to Wickert, includes a very real struggle for women against a daunting and still-sizable gender gap. Wickert’s deep involvement with Alexa at Sonos shows voice offers far more opportunities than just being a developer, and that it’s worth jumping in and taking the risk. Wickert advises women to search out companies willing to uphold them, and then share their stories to inspire others to do the same.
“Yes, it can be a hard road,” says Wickert. “But just imagine the experience you can have if you open yourself to all of the possibilities that voice enables. How can you not want to be a part of that?""

Introducing the Amazon Alexa Premium Far-Field Voice Development Kit;Fri Jan 05 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Gagan Luthra;"The Amazon Alexa Voice Service (AVS) makes it possible for developers and manufacturers to integrate Alexa directly into their connected products, without the need for natural language understanding or speech recognition technology specialists on their team. Today, we launch the Amazon Alexa Premium Far-Field Voice Development Kit, a new Amazon-developed reference solution for AVS that makes it easier for OEMs to build Alexa-enabled products with premium far-field performance.
The Amazon Alexa Premium Far-Field Voice Development Kit uses the same microphone array configurations found in the Amazon Echo and Echo Show. Devices built with this kit's far-field technology  can hear users from across the room, even in noisy environments or while playing music at loud volumes. The “far-field in a chip” architecture of this kit provides an easy-to-integrate audio front-end to developers building Alexa into commercial products. The development kit uses Amazon-developed audio algorithms, wake word engine, and client application technology, delivering a high level of compatibility and the rich feature-set of Alexa functionality.
In creating the Amazon Alexa Premium Far-Field Voice Development Kit, the AVS team focused on a core set of product objectives:

Premium far-field performance: The dev kit gives device manufacturers access to the same audio technology that powers the latest Amazon Echo family of devices, so they can bring high-quality voice experiences to their products.
Ease of integration: The audio algorithms and wake word engine are incorporated onto a single DSP chip, Intel’s dual DSP with inference engine, which simplifies integration and accelerates development times for manufacturers.
Adaptable configurations: The dev kit includes both 7-mic circular and 8-mic rectangular array boards, designed for 360-degree and 180-degree use cases. This makes the reference design suitable for tabletop devices that require voice pickup from all around, as well as devices that are placed near a wall, which require voice pickup primarily from one direction.

We’re bringing the Amazon Alexa Premium Far-Field Voice Development Kit to market with limited availability. Check back later for information on how to request a kit. For more information, please visit the product page.
“The Amazon Alexa Premium Far-Field Voice Development Kit is a significant step toward advancing our goal to provide tools and resources that help developers bring products to market that integrate with Alexa.

Amazon Alexa Mobile Accessories: A New Alexa-Enabled Product Category with Dev Tools Coming Soon;Fri Jan 05 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Gagan Luthra;"Millions of customers around the world have invited Amazon Alexa into their family, adding far-field voice control to rooms throughout the home. As customers fall in love with the convenience of using voice for hands-free control of their smart home, get weather updates, play music, and more, device makers have requested ways to integrate Alexa into mobile products that enable customers to take Alexa on-the-go.
Today, we’re excited to announce the Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit, a new way to bring Alexa to portable, on-the-go devices such as hearables, headphones, smart watches, fitness devices, and more. The kit enables OEMs to add Alexa to their devices with minimum investment in hardware or integration efforts.
With the Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit, OEM development teams no longer need to perform the bulk of the coding for their Alexa integration. Bluetooth audio-capable devices built with this new kit can connect directly to the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) via the Amazon Alexa App (for Android and iOS) on the customer’s mobile device. Customers who connect their devices with the Amazon Alexa App can take advantage of all the great features available through AVS, including streaming media, smart home capabilities, thousands of Alexa skills, calendar management, weather updates, and more.
Device makers who want to enable their Bluetooth audio-capable device to connect to Alexa for a hands-free voice experience will be able to leverage this new developer toolset later this year. You can sign up to be notified when it’s made available.

How to Control Your Cooking Devices with the Smart Home Skill API;Thu Jan 04 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Mike Maas;"Today we announced updates to the Smart Home Skill API to enable you to design skills that target cloud-connected microwave ovens. Here is an overview of how to connect your microwave to Alexa.
To create a skill for a microwave, follow the steps to build a smart home skill. However, describing food takes Alexa to a new level with the Smart Home Skill API. There are a few things to note when targeting a microwave, including:

Understand how Alexa processes customer requests and chooses directives to send
Understand how food is described in a directive or an event
Know how to describe a microwave in your device discovery response
 

How Alexa Determines the Cooking Directive to Send
When a customer asks Alexa to cook something, Alexa will ask follow-up questions as needed to determine how to describe the food being cooked and what directive to send.
There are four interfaces related to cooking that define directives. Here’s how Alexa chooses the directive to send your skill.
- If timed cooking applies and is supported, Alexa sends a time-cooking directive (described by the Alexa.Cooking.TimeController interface).
-or-
-  If a preset applies and is supported, Alexa sends a preset cooking directive (described by the Alexa.Cooking.PresetController interface).
- If the request is to pause or resume cooking, and they are supported, Alexa sends a hold or resume directive (described by Alexa.TimeHoldController).
- If none of the previous interfaces apply or are supported, Alexa sends a general cooking directive (described by the Alexa.Cooking interface).
For microwaves, you should always implement the Alexa.Cooking interface, but then you can choose additional interfaces to implement based on the capabilities of your endpoints. See each interface topic for more details and examples.
 
How Alexa Describes Food
If a customer specifies the type and quantity of food to cook, Alexa will send this information with the directive to your skill. However, when needed, Alexa uses what’s called a multi-turn dialog to find out the type and quantity of food to cook.
For example:
Customer: Defrost the chicken in the microwave
Alexa: What is the weight of the food you are defrosting?
Customer: 2 pounds
Alexa uses the food name specified by the customer to determine the food’s category. FoodCategory is an enumeration and contains entries such as MEAT, PASTA and POPCORN. Alexa understands that “chicken” means the CHICKEN category, and more complex things like “steak” means MEAT.
Either the customer will specify the number, weight or volume of the food to cook, or Alexa will ask questions until she knows. FoodQuantity, in a directive from Alexa, is polymorphic, meaning it can contain multiple descendant types; a Weight, Volume or FoodCount. The type will be specified by the @type field of the foodQuantity, which then determines the other fields sent. 
In general, the list of food quantity units that Alexa can send is smaller than the list of food quantity units she understands. This means you can describe food with a long list of units and Alexa will understand the information in your response event. For more information, see Weight and Volume.
The food from the example multi-turn dialog might be described like the following:
How You Describe Microwave Ovens in a Discovery Response
When you describe a microwave appliance in a discovery response, there are two you need to do:

Set the displayCategory to MICROWAVE.
Include configuration properties so Alexa knows if your devices support presets, the cooking modes supported, and more. This is in addition to the properties and interfaces you normally describe in a smart home discovery response.

In this example discovery response that describes a microwave, the microwave supports timed and preset cooking and the configuration properties are specified accordingly:
Get Started with Your Cooking Skill
Alexa handles many of the complexities of writing a skill for cooking appliances. She either interprets customer requests or asks enough questions until she understands their goal. Keep these tips in mind as you started developing skills for microwave ovens:

If you have never built a smart home skill before, review the basics. See Smart Home Skill API Message Reference and Steps to Build a Smart Home Skill before you move on to the next step.
If you have built a smart home skill previously and just want to focus on skills for microwave ovens, see Build Skills for Cooking Appliances.
Describing food is a more complex domain for Alexa than other smart home offerings. Make sure you test and thoroughly vet your skill before you submit it for certification.";https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2018/01/how-to-control-your-cooking-devices-with-the-smart-home-skill-api;
Introducing Cooking Capabilities in the Alexa Smart Home Skill API;Thu Jan 04 08:00:00 UTC 2018;Mike Maas;"Customers have now connected tens of millions of smart home devices to Alexa, including cameras, door locks, lights, entertainment systems, and thermostats. Today we are excited to introduce cooking capabilities as part of the Smart Home Skill API. Now you can build skills to enable customers in the US to control their microwave ovens using Alexa. Support for other cooking devices, such as conventional ovens, is coming soon. Cooking capabilities will also be available in other countries soon.
 
Extending Device Controls to Microwaves and Other Smart Appliances
Customers are increasingly using voice user interfaces (VUIs) as a hands-free way to manage their lives, and hands-free control is especially valuable when cooking. With the built-in cooking device controls in the Smart Home Skill API, you will make it easier for your customers to control your cloud-connected microwave. Instead of pressing multiple buttons to enable advanced microwave features, your customers can now use their voices.  For example, a customer can say “Alexa, defrost three pounds of chicken” or “Alexa, microwave for 50 seconds on high.”
Initially, there are four new capability interfaces in the Smart Home Skill API – Alexa.Cooking, Alexa.Cooking.TimeController, Alexa.TimeHoldController, and Alexa.Cooking.PresetController. You can leverage these interfaces today for microwaves and for appliances that support preset cooking. The interfaces are designed for future extensibility as support for more cooking devices becomes available.
 
How Developers are Using the New Cooking Capabilities
Whirlpool has created an Alexa skill leveraging these new cooking capabilities in the Smart Home Skill API for its connected microwaves, and expects to launch it soon. The skill enables customers to easily configure, start, and operate their connected Whirlpool microwaves. Customers can ask Alexa to set microwave cook times, modes, power levels, and more instead of using the traditional and often confusing microwave experience.
In addition, GE Appliances, Kenmore, LG, and Samsung are working on using the cooking capabilities in the Smart Home Skill API to let customers control their ovens and more appliances using Alexa in the future.
 
Alexa Fund Invests in June Oven, Leading the Future of the Smart Kitchen
Additionally, we are announcing that the Alexa Fund, our venture capital arm, has invested in June Life, makers of the June Oven, a countertop smart oven that makes cooking easier, faster, and tastier. We are excited about the innovations June is bringing to the smart kitchen, including their existing Alexa skill, and look forward to what they will create when we introduce support for ovens in the Smart Home Skill API.
“We’re excited to take the next step in our work with Amazon through the Alexa Fund investment and to offer our customers even more engaging voice experiences with their June Ovens. “We’re already bringing hands-free voice control to customers via our June Oven custom skill, which makes it incredibly convenient for them to do things like preheat the oven while they’re mixing ingredients, set and check timers, and stop cooking without taking off their oven mitts,” said Matt Van Horn, Co-Founder and CEO of June Life. This next development in Smart Home Skill API support for ovens will enable our owners to give shorter, simpler commands to their June Ovens and receive updates on their food as it is cooking. We look forward to exploring what else we can do with our skill as the oven support rolls out.”
