{"Title": "Kenneth S. Nugent Law Firm Forms Subcompany 1LAW to Exclusively Sell Amelia’s Conversational AI for Legal Assistance", "Date": "April 26, 2021 • 2 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\n1LAW provides Amelia as a platform that law firms can utilize for client intake and other legal services. \n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, April 26, 2021 — Amelia, the largest independent leader in enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI), today announced an additional partnership with Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. Attorneys at Law — a new arm of the law firm, 1LAW, that will exclusively sell Amelia’s legal services to other law firms.\nAmelia’s initial deployment with KSN filled the role of a digital legal assistant to offload duties for the premier law firm’s intake specialists, receptionists and legal teams. As she has helped the company sign up more than 1,100 new clients since joining the Nugent team, they decided to form 1LAW  where Amelia’s legal skills will be sold as a platform to other law firms to help them with intake and any other of their legal needs.\nFor KSN, Amelia serves the site’s 40,000 monthly web visitors and is the first point-of-contact for 100% of inbound calls from the firm’s 45 different phone lines. She handles more than 20,000 inbound calls per month for the firm, while handling 65% of those end to end. This results in a savings of roughly 125 hours a month for the firm’s receptionists. In addition, the law firm saves thousands of dollars monthly by layering Amelia into its after-hours phone system in lieu of an after-hours answering service. Amelia is also consistently involved with between 12-14% of the firm’s monthly sign-ups.\n“We’re thrilled that Amelia has excelled at being an around-the-clock legal assistant for the Nugent team, so much so that they believe that other law firms should be able to benefit as well,” said Chetan Dube, CEO and Founder of Amelia. “We look forward to 1LAW extending Amelia’s services to law firms throughout the country.”\n“Since Amelia joined the Nugent team, we have seen monumental progress and a world’s difference in freeing up our human workers to handle the complex legal problems we deal with daily,” said Tim Derrickson, Chief Technology Officer at Kenneth S. Nugent. “We’re excited to launch 1LAW and help law firms everyone reap the same benefits we do.”\nAbout Kenneth S. Nugent PC Attorneys at Law\nKen Nugent created one of the Southeast’s largest law firms devoted entirely to representing injury victims and their families, with eight offices scattered across the state in Albany, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Duluth, Macon, Savannah and Valdosta employing over 200 employees and 47 lawyers. For Nugent, success has allowed this native New Yorker the ability to provide a necessary service to people in times of need—an endeavor that’s steadied the compass of his firm’s mission. Nugent’s dedication to give back goes beyond the courtroom. From first graders to first responders, the avid sports fan has created a partnership with the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta United, Atlanta Braves, and Atlanta Hawks, which allows him to maintain programs that benefit Atlanta-area teachers and members of the Atlanta Police, Fire and EMT Departments, as well as a new partnership with the GA Bulldogs Sports Network that benefits military personnel across the state. Kenneth S. Nugent, Attorneys at Law recently created a community relations department, implementing the One Call Unites Us All campaign that sponsors service and social events in each community the law firm serves.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

{"Title": "April King Legal to Offer Clients Legal Advice with Amelia", "Date": "April 8, 2021 • 4 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nNottingham-based law firm hires Amelia as a digital legal assistant to improve the client experience of legal services.\n\n\n\n\n\nLondon, UK – 8 April 2021 – Amelia, the largest independent leader in enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI), today announced that April King Legal, a Nottingham-based private client law firm specialising in personal and corporate succession law, has introduced its industry-leading Digital Colleague, Amelia. The partnership will see Amelia take on the high volumes of client enquiries that April King receives and will lower the barrier to entry for legal advice.\nAfter recognising that the legal profession was being left behind in the wave of digital transformation, catalysing a dramatic shift in the business landscape, April King saw an opportunity to enhance its operations and customer service support through Conversational AI. The Amelia platform was picked over its competitors thanks to its unique capabilities, such as its Natural Language Processing (NLP) and emotional intelligence.\nIn the role of digital legal assistant, Amelia will adopt April King’s formal but warm conversational style when dealing with clients and will be named April, after the firm itself. Over a three-part implementation programme, the Amelia platform will start:\n\nServing requests for legal resources: In the first phase of her implementation, Amelia will handle the thousands of inbound enquiries that April King receives from customers looking to obtain its free information packs about wills, trusts and probates. Employees at April King would previously spend hours every day handling the large volumes of enquiries, a time-intensive and in turn costly initiative for the business. Releasing employees from this workload will empower them to focus on direct client liaison and case management.\nActing as the first point of contact for clients: In the second phase, Amelia will enable clients to book meetings via her own online interface without needing to call or email the firm. With more than 40,000 clients, diary management can be a complex challenge. As well as relieving employees of this administrative burden, they’ll be able to fully switch off at the end of the day knowing Amelia is available to clients 24/7 to manage their appointment requests.\nOffering free legal advice: To help April King achieve its mission of delivering the greatest possible customer experience and making its legal expertise more accessible, the final implementation is expected to introduce Amelia to clients as a triaging tool. In this role, she will become the first point of contact for all new clients, trained to offer initial legal advice to clients and triage cases effectively. By implementing Amelia in this way, the firm hopes to make its legal advice more affordable, providing free-of-charge general advice at the triage stage ahead of a formal meeting with one of its advisors. It will make the initial customer journey more efficient, engaging and informative with the aim of encouraging client uptake and reducing drop off.\n\nPaul King, CEO of April King Legal said: “The legal industry in the UK has fallen behind on customer expectations, with most other sectors having already advanced further down their digital transformation journey – particularly for AI adoption. This is perhaps unsurprising, given the sensitive nature of our work. However, the sophistication offered by the Amelia platform means that we have complete confidence in her ability to serve our clients in an accurate and emotionally cognisant manner. Indeed, we have such faith in her ability to act as a digital legal assistant that we are exploring how she can provide free-of-charge general advice, which will help us with our mission to make legal advice more accessible to all.”\nFaisal Abbasi, Managing Director Western Europe & MEMA, Amelia said: “The massive shift towards digital service consumption over the past year has transformed customer expectations for every industry. The legal sector is no exception - and digital experience has become the new customer battleground. There is immense potential for AI-powered digital legal assistants to offer a superior customer experience, while driving impressive productivity gains through the automation of previously time-intensive, mundane tasks. We are thrilled to be partnering with April King Legal as they set a new benchmark for intelligent digital services in what has been, to date, a rather risk-averse industry.”\nUnlike chatbots and more limited virtual assistants that react to keyword-driven instructions and follow static decision trees, the cognitive brain of the Amelia platform allows users to have natural, human-like conversations to execute tasks or resolve queries. Using advanced NLP, Amelia is also able to handle complex conversations and digressions, follow context switching, and independently execute complex tasks to resolve user requests. Her state-of-the-art affective computing and sentiment analysis enable her to recognise and adapt her responses based on the mood of the user and the context of the situation. These skills are constantly improving through her automated learning capabilities.\nAbout April King Legal\nApril King Legal is a leading Private Client law firm. With almost 30 years of experience, April King continues to go from strength to strength, with over 40,000 clients served across the UK. Their dedicated team of Solicitors, Chartered Legal Executives and other specialist lawyers provide practical, realistic and affordable ‘big picture’ legal solutions without the jargon.\nThe firm is perhaps best known for its unique approach to will drafting, which wholeheartedly rejects the standard mirror will narrative. Its innovative solutions provide more protection for clients’ wealth for future generations. Wider consideration is given of the client’s circumstances, dealing with matters outside the scope of simply making a will, such as business continuity and succession, and whether their estate is safe from future claims. This approach ensures the client’s goals are brought into effect in the long term, whatever changes life may bring.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

{"Title": "How Amelia is Designed for Modern Business Challenges", "Date": "December 14, 2020 • 1 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nUnlike past cognitive computing attempts, the industry-leading virtual assistant, Amelia, is perfectly matched to address business challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent article by Neil Raden for Diginomica compares past unsuccessful attempts at cognitive computing with the new generation of Conversational AI solutions, such as Amelia. To provide context for the comparison, Raden reflects on the development of decision services, which now combine “predictive modeling, business rules, entity analytics, AI/ML, optimization, NLP, and cognitive computing.”\nRaden stresses the importance of adaptability for cognitive systems. He says they need to “have memory for solving problems,” and they need to understand context, such as “meaning, syntax, time, location.”\nTo provide an example of “what not to do,” Raden describes IBM’s Watson for Oncology. The technology was supposed to “make dramatic improvements in healthcare” but it ultimately failed. Despite the technology’s ability to quickly gather and use information, it could not match the complexity of the healthcare system.\nIn comparison, the author shows how Amelia is perfectly matched to address enterprises’ business challenges. Amelia is much more advanced than chatbots.

In the article, the author explores the role AI can play by interacting with patients in order to enable doctors and nurses to practice safe social distancing.\n“A few dozen robots is not going to make a big dent in the coronavirus outbreak, but it could be a sign of what's coming,” the author writes. “Artificial Intelligence has made big steps forward in tasks like processing speech, which is making digital helpers more and more useful.”\nAs a prime example of AI and its role in human collaboration, the author detailed the way users interview and hire Amelia on Digitalworkforce.ai:\n“[IPsoft] develops software packages designed to fulfil roles traditionally performed by people, such as an IT service desk engineer. Via its new online marketplace, prospective employers can interview the company's assistant Amelia to decide if they should take on a digital employee rather than a person. Costing $1,800 (£1,460) a month, their IT troubleshooter can reset passwords, unlock accounts and deal with up to 1,000 inquiries a month.”\nThe author does an excellent job balancing the societal fears associated with AI assuming human tasks as compared to the human benefits AI will provide in collaborative tasks.

{"Title": "HFS Research Highlights Five Critical Requirements for Designing a Hybrid Workforce of Digital and Human Employees", "Date": "February 18, 2020 • 4 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nNew report reviews best practices from enterprise leaders for deploying automation and cognitive AI when creating hybrid workforces to maximize business value.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, February 18, 2020 — HFS Research, in collaboration with IPsoft, the leader in enterprise AI, last week released a new report detailing the five most critical requirements when designing, building and deploying Digital Employees in order to achieve maximum business value within a company.\nDownload the report here.\nWe’re deep in a transition from traditional labor and physical business models towards those that are touchless and digital. However, many businesses are struggling to make the shift, with a study from HFS Research, supported by KPMG, revealing that a combined 40% of 2,000 C-level enterprise leaders say that their most immediate business pressures are shifting from physical to digital experiences, and providing personalization and customization of products to customers.\nIn the new report, Propel Your Business Operations ‘Straight to Digital’ with Digital Associates, HFS Research advocates that enterprises should use conversational AI-powered Digital Associates (another term for Digital Employees) to move “Straight to Digital” and tailor solutions, products and overall customer experiences. Digital Associates (Digital Employees) are tools that combine conversational and cognitive learning capabilities to drive business outcomes, such as reducing costs, improving productivity and providing better customer experiences.\nThe report also provides a critical roadmap for organizations looking to take advantage of these automation and cognitive AI technologies.\nFive Critical Requirements for Designing a Hybrid Workforce \nSpeaking to five enterprises that have introduced digital employees into different business processes, from customer services to IT service desk management, HFS Research identified five critical principles for designing a hybrid workplace and deploying AI-powered conversational systems.\nDespite the wide variety of use cases, the report states that these five important principles will “help [companies] define and execute on a strategy that benefits all of the stakeholders in [their] ecosystem rather than just having a ‘tick-the-box’ approach to the technology.”\nThe five principles for designing a hybrid workplace and deploying AI-powered conversational systems are:\n\nEmpower your employees with digital [employees] to provide superior customer service, for example, with the digital employee acting as a whisper agent to guide the employee to improve consistency and accuracy.\n\n\nTrain your digital [employees] to achieve the desired outcomes and set them up to deliver against future use cases. As with human employees, investment should be made in identifying where the digital employee can create the most value, and the information and processes that will enable them to achieve this. \n\n\nDesign digital [employees] to be “channel agnostic” to make experiences touchless and seamless. People don’t tend to think in terms of channel, they just want issues resolved (whether it’s a password reset or product refund). Create a central, seamless hub from which users can get the immediate support they need, whether they want to use text or voice to interact. \n\n\nApply smart design tactics to remove high friction, low-value human interactions. Identify interactions that are time-consuming, repetitive and low-value that digital employees can completely take over. Then, design the automated process based on how the human would interact to this query to deliver a seamless end-user experience. This means human representatives can focus on interactions with greater value to the customer or with higher revenue potential for the company.\n\n\nLeverage digital [employees] to drive compliance and security throughout your organization by having them validate self-serve processes that might otherwise have taken human employees countless hours of resolution time. This also helps increase the security of processes information and reduces the risk of errors that can trigger security and regulatory issues, particularly in highly-regulated industries like healthcare and finance.\n\nHFS Research also confirmed the value of using Digital Employees to augment the capabilities of human employees. The study determined that companies deploying Digital Employees strategically to empower human employees deliver better customer service than those that use AI solely as an opportunity to reduce headcount.\nChetan Dube, IPsoft Founder and CEO commented: “We’re seeing increased integration between human and digital employees in the workplace to drive positive experiences and outcomes for all of an organization’s stakeholders – customers, partners, employees and shareholders alike. This new study from HFS Research has revealed how important it is for organizations to move ‘Straight to Digital’ to remain competitive through reducing costs, improving productivity and providing better customer experiences.”\n“Based on our experience working with global leading organizations, we recognize the five critical requirements that HFS Research has identified as integral to the success of any hybrid workforce initiative. Our partners have pioneered this approach and achieved tremendous results when aligning human and digital employees for collaborative work experiences. These trailblazers have helped establish the roadmap so that organizations across all sectors can be confident in achieving a tangible Return on AI Investment (ROAI).”\nIPsoft’s Digital Employee, Amelia has repeatedly been identified as industry-leading by independent analyst firms, including Forrester, Everest Group and Ovum.\nJoin the Conversation on ‘Straight to Digital’\nTo expand on the issues and insights in the report, HFS Research will be hosting a free webinar on Friday, Feb. 28th at 11 am ET/4 pm GMT to review how Digital Associates can deliver operational and business value within any organization. The webinar also will include enterprise leaders discussing their “Straight to Digital” journeys. \nVisit DigitalWorkforce.ai™\nStart building your future workforce today through DigitalWorkforce.ai, the one-stop online marketplace where users can browse, interview and onboard Digital Employees™ powered by Amelia®, the industry-leading cognitive AI solution.

Ovum acknowledges her as market-leading Conversational AI technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmelia ranked as best-in-class technology in Ovum’s Decision Matrix for Intelligent Virtual Assistant Solutions\nNEW YORK, January 3, 2020 — IPsoft, the global leader in enterprise AI, today was recognized in the “Ovum Decision Matrix: Selecting an Intelligent Virtual Assistant Solution, 2020–21” as a Leader among 11 evaluated companies. In the report, Ovum, an independent analyst firm, acknowledges IPsoft’s Amelia as market-leading conversational AI technology, offering strong language support, facial recognition and a large number of vertical integrations that work in concert to deliver best-in-class user experiences.\nAs part of its research, Ovum ranked 11 enterprise AI companies based on customer references and structured vendor briefings, among other criteria. In the analyst firm’s evaluation, Amelia is highlighted for the speed and ease involved in training her to handle new roles. “Amelia’s NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is based on ELMo (embedding for language models) — ELMo uses not just individual words in the conversation but also context through surrounding words being spoken. The result is that less data is required to train the cognitive model, making it easier to deploy a customer solution,” according to the report. “When Amelia is trained for a language, it’s always natively direct to model, with no intermediate language translation to an existing model.”\nThe Ovum Decision Matrix also underscores differentiating factors that allow Amelia to perform tasks with human intelligence and emotional understanding. “IPsoft develops language packs which plug into Amelia together with all the other components such as sentiment analysis,” the report states. “It also classifies conversation using a neural network trained on the psychological pleasure, arousal [and] dominance (PAD) emotional state model used to represent all emotions to provide additional context.”\nCompanies around the world are utilizing Amelia in a variety of industries to improve IT support, elevate customer service and generate new revenue. Amelia is designed to deliver the best elements of human interaction – conversation, expression, emotion and understanding – to everyday user experiences, driving deeper customer connections and greater business value. Amelia´s cognitive brain includes state-of-the-art affective computing and sentiment analysis to enable it to model and appropriately respond to a user's emotions, mood and personality.\nWith more than 20 years of AI and automation experience, IPsoft is continually improving Amelia by reducing the effort required to train and build conversational solutions for numerous industries and use cases, a factor that Ovum highlights in its research.\n“IPsoft is also the only vendor in this [report] to offer facial recognition out-of-the-box,” the report states. “An example use case is kiosks with a human-like avatar to allow for more personalized experiences. IPsoft also has different Amelias that can work in concert, e.g. an IT Service Desk Amelia, an HR Amelia, [and] a back-office Amelia, forming groups of individual Amelias and then connecting these bots across domains.”\n“To be named as a leader in the Ovum Decision Matrix is an honor and a testament to the remarkable accomplishments of our clients and partners working with automation and cognitive AI,” said Chetan Dube, IPsoft Founder and CEO. “IPsoft is diligent in making Amelia the most human and dynamic Digital Employee in the industry. It is a privilege when our efforts, and those of our clients, receive this kind of recognition.”\nAbout Ovum\nOvum is part of FTSE 100 Informa Group, one of the world’s leading providers of business intelligence. Informa has over 6,500 employees and delivers specialized information to companies operating in sectors including finance, telecoms, media and IT. A market-leading data, research and consulting business, Ovum is focused on helping digital service providers and their technology partners thrive in the connected digital economy.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

By adding these advanced forms of automation — including the automation of complex user engagements via a conversational interface — human colleagues are able spend more time on more rewarding tasks (i.e., non-mundane repeatable ones).

What’s more, there is also a growing opportunity for corporations to create and apply ROAI metrics to AI’s impact on the global workforce, and these could also provide important barometers of corporate value.”\nJust as these technologies have evolved over time, so have the metrics used to determine their success.  “Net Promoter Scores and customer satisfaction ratings are well-worn indicators, but only tell part of the story,” Chetan explained. “Improved satisfaction among employees whose jobs are assisted or enhanced by AI technologies is a telltale sign of value, as it can lead to better worker retention, lowered attrition rates and improved employee interactions with external customers.”\nIn addition to other metrics, Chetan recommended that companies “monitor any increase in activity on social channels where consumers are more than eager to share what are hopefully positive experiences with their preferred brands. While imperfect, such activity can provide insight into whether a company’s AI initiatives are helping (or hurting) the building of brand loyalty.”\nYou can read more of Chetan’s op-eds for Forbes here.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsoft-ceo-in-forbes-on-the-relationship-of-cx-and-roi/", "Role": ""},

However, it can also be used to build (or re-build) trust with consumers via empowered self-resolutions, uniform compliance to protocols and transparent recordings of all transactions. This trust-building functionality is particularly vital in industries that deal with highly personal services such as finance.\nFollowing a number high-profile scandals, The Banking Royal Commission in Australia was established to investigate misconduct in the country’s banking sector, concluding with a final report issued this past February. As the industry now looks to reestablish its reputation with the public, one highly logical avenue of restoration leads through AI-powered automation. The Australian Financial Review (registration required) recently highlighted the potential of our industry-leading virtual agent Amelia to do just that.\n“All the banks here will tell you that after the Royal Commission report they’re working on restoring trust,” says IPsoft’s Chief Commercial Officer Jonathan Crane, who was interviewed for the piece. “You do that through compliance and monitoring from a regulatory standpoint.” Indeed, Amelia is uniquely suited to assist companies in highly regulated sectors such as banking through the delivery of transparent, consistent and personalized experiences that can be quickly modified to match evolving compliance protocols.\nThe AFR feature goes on to highlight IPsoft’s history, our plans for the Australian market and other issues related to the AI landscape overall. Jonathan goes on to directly address ongoing fears that intelligent technologies will replace human workers, reiterating how — just like past technological shifts — AI benefits workers by automating menial high-volume, low-business value tasks. “I think we’ll see more and more use of technology in partnership with humans,” he says. “We don’t want to mistake AI implementation for job elimination.”\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/australian-financial-review-profiles-amelias-potential-for-banks/", "Role": ""},

With more than 75 world-leading content sources, Compelo educates, informs and influences businesses and communities across the globe. See what the media company had to say about Amelia’s great work with Swedish bank SEB.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we launched 1Bank last year, we promised to usher in an era of conversational banking guided by cognitive Artificial Intelligence (AI). Compelo, a UK-based banking trade publication, featured Amelia in a recent article about the many ways that AI is impacting financial institutions.\nThe author describes Amelia as a digital colleague “that can be deployed visually and engages in natural, non-linear conversations with customers to help them solve queries.” The piece highlights our work with Swedish bank SEB, which deployed Amelia as both an IT service desk agent and as a customer-facing service representative.\nIn 2016, SEB hired Amelia to automate many internal IT service tasks for its 14,000-plus workforce such as unlocking Active Directory accounts and answering FAQs. Following a successful internal implementation, the bank expanded Amelia’s scope to customer-facing activities. Amelia was soon providing services to millions of customers, which they could access through a Swedish-language conversational interface.\nAmelia successfully automated many functions such as branch location inquiries, password resets for online accounts, and troubleshooting problems with credit and debit cards. Her abilities have since expanded to additional tasks such as ID verification questioning.\nAs a customer-facing representative at SEB, she addresses approximately 200 queries per day. Amelia has been able to deliver faster service to customers and increase employee satisfaction. She also has allowed shareholders to secure a competitive advantage over other banking institutions through optimized customer service.\n“With Amelia, SEB offers customers an opportunity to get an immediate response to their questions, which in turn concentrates the call volume for live human agents on the highest value support areas,” IPsoft‘s Executive Director of Transformations Johan Toll told Compelo. “Currently, Amelia is handling customer queries such as password resets for online banking accounts, helping users to step-by-step troubleshoot problems with credit and debit cards, and providing the location of the nearest bank.”\nWe believe we’re at the forefront of a conversational banking revolution and we’re grateful that Compelo chronicled some of our great work.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/sebs-work-with-amelia-highlighted-by-compelo/", "Role": ""},

Read this article to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO Forum is pleased to announce that Robert Reiss, Host and CEO of The CEO Forum recently spoke with IPsoft CEO and Founder Chetan Dube. They discussed the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI), why human-like conversation skills are necessary for digital assistants, and how digital solutions will help large enterprises improve internal operations.\nDuring the interview, Chetan examined the difference between digital colleagues such as IPsoft’s Amelia and chatbots. Amelia “is the most human AI,” he said. “Today, if you cross the street you’re going to hit a chatbot. There are tons of chatbots in the industry. So, what’s real and what’s not real? Can these chatbots drive up good Net Promoter Scores? Can they drive up good customer experience? Can they deliver your companies to be growing up on the digital Darwinistic curve that we’re living in the middle of? That’s where Amelia is different…You need almost human capability.”\nDuring the conversation, Chetan also discussed the impact of AI on healthcare, why humans shouldn’t be concerned about AI going rogue, and whether machines can think creatively.\nThe CEO Forum, located in Ridgefield, Connecticut, was founded in 2007 by Robert Reiss to disseminate CEO wisdom to elevate business, the economy and society. The CEO Forum helps CEOs to become more successful by developing impactful platforms and tools for storytelling, learning and connections. It is recognized as “The Transformative CEO Community” for its efforts in helping to build success, one CEO at a time, by sharing best practices, driving job creation and expanding innovation and value throughout the world.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsoft-ceo-chetan-dube-featured-on-the-ceo-forum/", "Role": ""},

As the public becomes more comfortable interacting with AI, the ability to mimic wordless communication will become increasingly vital.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most exciting frontiers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is how AI-powered cognitive agents like Amelia allow humans to interact with technology using natural language, just as they would if they were talking to another human. However, there is obviously much more to human communication than merely understanding and processing words and phrases. The human face is just as important to convey information and emotion. This is why IPsoft has developed a 3D human avatar for Amelia (based on real-life model Lauren Hayes) that can foster natural, human-like interactions.\nAmelia’s human avatar was highlighted on ServiceNow’s Workflow site in a blog titled “The changing faces of AI.” Those IPsoft customers that utilize Amelia’s 3D avatar can open new dimensions of interactivity. As IPsoft services more than a dozen industries across a wide range of use cases, we’ve adopted “a mix-and-match” approach, according to IPsoft’s Chief Commercial Officer Jonathan Crane, who is quoted in the piece.\nAI-powered virtual assistants, as the piece highlights, are growing at an astounding 25% annual rate and are predicted by Juniper Research to save businesses $8 billion per year in overhead costs by 2022. Not only can Amelia understand human speech, but her industry-leading sentiment analysis allows her to discern human emotional states, which the avatar can be trained to react to. As users become more comfortable with interacting with cognitive agents, this additional dimension of communication will become an increasingly vital part of the user experience.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/servicenow-highlights-ipsoft-leadership-in-ai-human-interactions/", "Role": ""},

The piece also sings the praises of IPsoft’s Amelia. Read more to find out how Amelia can help your business today.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent post on IDG Connect examines the impact Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have on the workplace. The piece, which outlines the major differences between chatbots and cognitive solutions, as well as the importance of reskilling human workers to collaborate with AI, heaps high praise on IPsoft’s cognitive solution, Amelia.\n“Amelia has been over five years in the making and when she was shown off to us, it was clear she’s something to be proud of,” the article reads.\n“[She can] speak like her human counterparts, adjusting her tone to match the business requirements of the industry she’s working in and understanding and responding appropriately to the perceived emotion of her conversational partner,” the author writes. “If she can’t solve a problem, Amelia observes how her human colleagues handle the situation, learns from their example and can then apply that knowledge to similar situations in the future.”\nThe author deftly distinguishes between Amelia and chatbots by describing the “shallow neural networks built to follow a decision tree” that chatbots use, compared to the “episodic memory, process memory, and intent recognition” that powers Amelia’s human-like intelligence. The author also cites research that claims chatbots have a lower IQ than a six-year-old child.\nIn other words, “Amelia certainly isn’t just a chatbot.”\nWhat This Means for the Workforce\n“It’s clear to most that as AI-enabled technologies continue to become the new workplace norm, the way we work is going to be increasingly disrupted,” the piece states. IDG asserts that organizations have already begun internal training programs for employees and clients designed to help workers learn new AI-based skills in order to thrive in an AI-infused workforce. We’ve also observed this at our client and partner organizations.\nIt’s also important to note that Amelia doesn’t simply replace the human worker whose tasks she may have assumed; rather, she becomes a collaborative digital colleague that works side-by-side with employees to simplify complex tasks. She finds answers, she remembers past customer interactions, she locates documents, and she runs analytics, among many other skills.\n“From banking to healthcare, insurance and even education, Amelia’s capabilities as a digital colleague are already being put to the test and, as organizations seek new solutions to their business problems, you might just find that your next new starter is completely digital,” the author writes.\nWe couldn’t agree more.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/idg-amelia-is-something-to-be-proud-of/", "Role": ""},

The first comes from software vendors and service providers such as IPsoft. The second is built around comprehensive cognitive engines such as IPsoft’s Amelia.\nThe report, which was authored by HfS Research analysts Tom Reuner and Charles Sutherland, recognizes that for core Autonomics, IPsoft was the poster child that dominated the early discussions. Its IPcenter platform provides a consolidated end-to-end automation framework encompassing Level 1 and Level 2 activities (i.e., Level 1 is basic customer support; Level 2 involves technical knowledge such as break/fix or configuration). IPsoft’s poignantly coined \"virtual engineers\" provide algorithmically enforced process engineering. Typical tasks include event management, incident management, request management, and change management.\nIPsoft extended this IT Helpdesk use case to business processes by launching the Amelia cognitive platform.\nAmelia is a virtual agent that analyzes natural language, understands context, applies logic, infers implications, learns, resolves problems as well and senses emotions.\nThe report states, “As such, it is vastly different from existing low-level virtual agents that only repeat scripted passages.”\nAccording to Dr. Tom Reuner, Managing Director, Research, HfS Research, “IPsoft is strongly positioned across in HfS’ Intelligent Automation Continuum spanning both the Autonomics Platforms and Cognitive Computing categories that make up the Continuum towards true artificial intelligence.”\n“We are proud to be recognized by an independent analyst firm, such as HfS Research,\" said Chetan Dube, CEO of IPsoft. “2016 will be the year of cognitive and IPsoft is at the heart of this industry evolution.”\nTo learn more about how Amelia can improve your business operations and client interactions, please visit amelia.com/amelia.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

{"Title": "IPsoft Humanizes Artificial Intelligence with the Next Generation of its Cognitive Agent, Amelia", "Date": "October 7, 2015 • 3 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nIn addition to progress in humanizing Amelia, architectural changes have been made to the platform in order to ensure that she is capable of supporting rapidly rising market demand. The entire backbone has been rewritten ensuring Amelia deployments can scale seamlessly and remain resilient throughout extreme peaks in volume.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York, October 7, 2015 – IPsoft today announced Version 2.0 of Amelia, its artificial intelligence platform that automates knowledge work across a broad range of business functions. The new updates bring Amelia closer to achieving near human cognitive capabilities and will be demonstrated for the first time at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo in Orlando by IPsoft CEO, Chetan Dube.\nThe growing maturity of Amelia’s core understanding capabilities will widen the range of roles she can execute and the breadth of knowledge she can absorb. In parallel, Amelia’s physical appearance and expressiveness have been transformed to create a more human like avatar capable of deepening customer engagement. Her new animation form has been entirely remodeled on that of a real person.\nWithin a matter of years, IPsoft plans to put the model and her facesake, Amelia, on stage and have a distinguished panel of analysts and journalists ask questions of the human and the machine. “In just one year we have seen Amelia ‘grow up’ tremendously. Just imagine how her maturity will accelerate over the next five,” said Chetan Dube, IPsoft CEO. “We are fast approaching the moment when technology is knocking at the Turing horizon, where machine intelligence starts to match human intelligence. Amelia will be the harbinger of that shift, inviting us to re-evaluate the relationship between man and machine in order to create a more efficient planet.”\nAs Amelia becomes more human in her interaction with customers, so the positive impact she has on business operations grows. Version 2.0 makes huge strides in terms of dialogue management comprehension and emotional engagement through the following technology developments:\n\nMemory: Amelia’s declarative memory now consists of episodic memory and semantic memory, exactly the way human memory is organized. In humans, semantic memory activates the frontal and temporal cortexes, while episodic memory activity is mostly concentrated in the hippocampus. Similarly, episodic memory of Amelia gives her cognition of various experiences and events in time in a sequenced autobiographical form. Her semantic memory gives her a structured record of facts, meanings, concepts and knowledge about the client world. The combination of the two allows Amelia to hold a wholly natural conversation that is not restricted to following set flows.\nContextual comprehension: Concepts and ideas in the human brain are semantically linked, so that thinking about or firing one set of neurons in your head primes other related ones, making them more likely to fire in future. This allows localized querying in the human brain as opposed to typical search based algorithms which traverse the entire data set before trying to compute an answer. Amelia now emulates that capability so that she can quickly and reliably retrieve information across a wider and more complex set of knowledge.\nEmotional responsiveness: Repeatedly, research shows that a better customer experience is directly tied to empathy shown by the agent throughout the interaction. In addition to an EQ quotient, Amelia now has a mood and a personality vector in a 3-dimensional emotional space. This enables her to keep track of every client interaction and allows her to adapt her responses accordingly so that she delivers personal service to every customer.\n\nIn addition to progress in humanizing Amelia, architectural changes have been made to the platform in order to ensure that she is capable of supporting rapidly rising market demand. The entire backbone has been rewritten ensuring Amelia deployments can scale seamlessly and remain resilient throughout extreme peaks in volume.\nChetan Dube will present Amelia V2.0 on October 7, 2015 at 3.45pm EST, at Gartner’s Symposium in Orlando, Florida.\nTo learn more about how Amelia can improve your business operations and client interactions, please visit amelia.com/amelia.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

The service will leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with customers, in English and Japanese, and learn from experiences to successively upgrade the quality of customer experience provided through NTT’s Contact Center services.\nIn combination with IPsoft’s artificial intelligence platform, Amelia, NTT will be delivering its new cognitive agent service using advanced Japanese-language processing technology that NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories has been developing for four decades.\nThe cognitive agent service will use cloud-based AI to automate initial responses to customers who contact a service center in search of support or to make a purchase. Large enterprises who use the service will be able to ensure they provide a high-quality 24/7 response to their customers while refocusing employee workloads on higher value activities. The service will initiate actions to complete a caller request, for example, issuing invoices, sending emails or mailing documents.\nPrior to launching a commercial service, NTT Com will invite enterprises to participate in Proof of Concept (PoC) testing from February 2016.\nService Features\n\nBased on highly natural conversations with customers, the service will be able to complete a wide range of incoming requests as well as help to diagnose and resolve customer problems.\nIn cases where a customer’s request is vague, the service will query them for more information to diagnose the problem fully. The service’s high level of accuracy will eliminate the need to repeatedly ask the caller for confirmations (for example, “If this is correct, please press 1”). It also will generate questions flexibly, thereby freeing customers from being forced to follow a rigid rule-based dialogue.\nIf a problem or request cannot be resolved automatically, the service will transfer the call to a live operator. Moreover, it will use AI to learn from the operator’s response and apply this knowledge when responding to similar situations in the future. This efficient learning cycle will enable the service to become increasingly efficient over time.\nThe service will be able to initiate follow-up action at the caller’s request, such as revising information in an application, correcting a billing error or changing various settings by connecting to the user-company’s enterprise system.\n\nGoing forward, NTT Com expects to offer related services in various fields, leveraging both AI and the company’s highly safe and reliable cloud environment built with carrier-level quality.\nTo learn more about how Amelia can improve your business operations and client interactions, please visit amelia.com/amelia.\nAbout NTT Communications Corporation\nNTT Communications provides consultancy, architecture, security and cloud services to optimize the information and communications technology (ICT) environments of enterprises.

The Swedish bank will be the first in the industry to embrace IPsoft’s cognitive technology in order to deliver an enhanced customer experience for its million-strong client base in Sweden using local language. The decision to place Amelia in the front office builds on the successful first phase deployment of Amelia in an internal IT Service Desk supporting SEB’s 15,000 strong workforce.\nBy employing Amelia, the bank is accelerating progress towards its innovation goals and differentiating its service from others in the market. “Customer service is a key differentiator. By making Amelia available to respond to queries, we enhance our customers’ flexibility of receiving individualized support at a time that suits them and without any delays in response,” said Rasmus Järborg, SEB’s Chief Strategy Officer. “Our confidence in the positive experience Amelia can offer customers is built on the success of our internal program to employ Amelia as an IT Service Desk agent. Within the first three weeks, she held over 4000 conversations with 700 users and was able to resolve the majority of those queries independently, allowing employees to get consistent support without delay.”\nIPsoft will also help SEB set up its own cognitive center of excellence in order to build an in-house talent pool of individuals who can mentor Amelia. They will supervise her learning, monitor her performance and identify new opportunities for applying this technology to re-shape customer journeys. This initiative sets a new standard for enterprises that are adapting their skills base to optimize the adoption of cognitive technology.\n“Digital labor will provide a fundamental shift in the way that banks manage their operations and provide a platform on which it is possible to launch new services. The burden of guaranteeing compliance adherence, for example, could become a thing of the past as virtual agents never deviate from regulations and provide a full audit trail of every interaction.

{"Title": "AI will make us more human, shattering the glass ceiling of productivity", "Date": "January 29, 2017 • 4 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nGround-breaking University of London and IPsoft research envisages FuturaCorp – the idealized man + machine organization of the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrival of AI in the workplace has potential to triple productivity in the near term\nMore than 80 percent of repetitive, process-oriented tasks soon to be automated\nBut automation of routine work to sharpen the higher-level creative and innovative capabilities of our human minds\nLessons for leadership – formula developed to score businesses’ readiness for AI\n\nNYC: January 30, 2017 – In the near future, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will free our minds from process-oriented repetition, refocusing time and capital for our most human of pursuits: innovation and creativity. The result will be a revolutionary shift in workplace productivity and fundamental restructuring of work as we know it. So finds a groundbreaking new academic study released today by researchers at Goldsmiths, University of London in association with IPsoft. The study, FuturaCorp: Artificial Intelligence & The Freedom To Be Human, proposes a vision of \"FuturaCorp\" – an idealized man + machine workplace of tomorrow.\nBy enabling companies to automate repetitive tasks and redeploy humans in higher-skill roles, FuturaCorp will realize a productivity jump of up to 3.5 times that of today’s organizations, according to the research. But, as we better understand how AI can complement and amplify the creative power of humans, this figure has the potential to rise significantly further.\nThe research describes job roles as comprised of a series of tasks. Some are repetitive and process-oriented (deterministic). Some require a human in concert with machines (probabilistic). Some rely on the types of connections that can only be made by the human brain, from ideas generation to complex problem solving (cross-functional reasoning). The Goldsmiths team expects that, in the not too distant future:\n\nMore than 80% of deterministic tasks will be done by machines\nProbabilistic tasks will be shared 50:50 by machines and humans\nBut humans will still carry out 80% of all cross-functional reasoning tasks\n\nDr. Chris Brauer, Director of Innovation and Senior Lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London, explains: “The real productivity benefits of AI will not be simply a factor of automating existing processes. The arrival of AI will engender entirely new, unknown possibilities for humans and what they can achieve.\n“It is this new configuration of humans working alongside intelligent machines that will be the source of sustained competitive advantage. The result will be FuturaCorp - a Fortune 500 with the innovative flexibility of a Silicon Valley start-up, or a start-up with the IT power of a Fortune 500.”\nThe study paints an optimistic picture for the future for individuals, pointing to previous waves of automation resulting in low-skill work replaced by new, higher-skill jobs. It predicts that the arrival of the robots in the workplace will make us more human, pointing to crucial human skills that we will need in FuturaCorp to complement our digital colleagues. The research also imagines example roles that don’t exist today but may be critical in the man + machine organization of the future [see Appendix below].\nChetan Dube, CEO and President of IPsoft comments: “AI engenders emergent individual qualities, which push us to access the more complex parts of our minds. When routine work is automated, we will be able – and required – to flex our most human of skills. To do what the machines can’t, and likely never will be able to do. The future of society relies on individuals accessing higher reasoning, critical thinking and complex problem solving skills.”\nHowever, the need for rapid and strategic skill transformation could lead to a near-term skills shortage, according to the research. The Goldsmiths team found little widespread evidence of universities and training institutions preparing individuals to manage these looming future shifts. Organizations, meanwhile, are currently focused on in-house training, as retention is extremely difficult and significant investment hard to justify.\nFinally, the research team developed in liaison with IPsoft a first-of-its-kind ‘organizational readiness equation’ for business leaders to assess how equipped their company is to take its first brave steps into an AI future.\nThe equation scores an organization in relation to the utopian vision of FuturaCorp, and helps C-Suite leaders to determine what changes need to be made across the firm to push the business model towards this ideal.\nChetan Dube concludes: “CEOs must be prepared to redefine their business in order to capitalize on the productivity potential of AI. That journey begins with fundamental change to organization structure, who they hire for which roles, and how they use the new relationship between humans and machines to maximize efficiency and innovation.”\nAppendix: 5 possible new roles in FuturaCorp:\nRoles will change significantly in the next five to ten years. New examples we expect will emerge are below. But this list plays on the way we understand work and occupations today. In the future, there may not be ‘roles’, but instead a set of actions that make up a person’s daily work.\n\nChief of Innovation\nSenior management who will successfully steer companies through the upcoming change and disruption. Technical knowledge combined with business strategy, creative, able to get best from the probabilistic functions to pivot the company in new directions.\n\n\nInformation Insight Enabler\nData analysts that will help companies make sense and derive insights from the torrent of data generated by technological disruptions. Coaches and technologists, bridging the relationships between humans and machines via the data generated.\n\n\nFreelance Professor\nContinued growth of online courses and the introduction of alternative accreditations will spawn a growth in freelance or independent professors. In-house training and ‘cognitive centers’ are the beginning of spaces to skill up the current workforce\n\n\nTechnology Broker\nBuying advice and negotiating support to divisions across a company to ensure all technology is compatible and collaborate.

The key differentiation is that Virtual Agents are progressing beyond simple Q&A services, toward being capable of executing complex processes and performing self-remediation. These new advanced Virtual Agents can connect directly with applications and integrate with lower level capabilities such as desktop automation and RPA where these steps are part of a broader execution.\nThe report finds IPsoft’s Amelia leading at the forefront of Virtual Agents. IPsoft has developed its Amelia platform as a virtual agent which is capable of analyzing language, understanding context and applying logic to conversations. Amelia automates interactions by integrating vast knowledge libraries into conversations to determine how best to help the customers she supports. She learns from each exchange and applies this knowledge to future dialogues. This approach aims at creating conversational, human-like interaction, that is unlike traditional chatbots.\nTwo major enterprises currently implementing Amelia within their customer service organizations were interviewed for the research.\nAccording to HfS Chief Analyst and CEO, Phil Fersht, “The most captivating value of cognitive automation, in today's consumer-centric enterprise, is the rapid emergence of the virtual agent, where customer engagement is enriched without heavy incremental investments in support staff. This isn't about replacing a real customer service rep with an avatar; it's elevating the existing customer experience.”\n“We are proud to see that the report highlights that Amelia is leading at the forefront of Virtual Agents and delivering business impact. Digital labor will provide a fundamental shift in the way that companies manage their operations and provide a platform on which it is possible to launch new services. We are just at the starting point in this cognitive revolution,” said Chetan Dube, CEO of IPsoft.\nAbout HfS Research\nHfS Research is The Services Research Company™ — the leading analyst authority and global community for business operations and IT services.

The two offices in Paris and Madrid mark another step in rapid expansion for IPsoft as AI adoption becomes a boardroom issue across all industries.\n“Demand is accelerating across Europe,” says Frank Lansink, CEO IPsoft, EMEA. “Productivity needs to increase in the region in order to offset slow economic growth. CEOs operating in a digital economy recognize they need to employ a digital workforce to compete successfully for customers and investors on a global stage.”\n“France and Spain provide 22.5% of the EU’s GDP and are amongst the top 5 largest European economies. We have projects underway with many leading banks, insurers and telecommunications providers in both countries and will be able to accelerate adoption of AI by establishing local teams. Pioneers, such as European Bank, SEB, have been amongst the first to adopt Amelia, our virtual agent, and as a result are gaining a head start on building valuable knowledge and experience on how to maximize the impact of digital employees.”\nRecent studies from IDC show that AI adoption in Western Europe is growing fast with corporate investment reaching a 42.5% compound annual growth rate by 2020.1 “It is clear that deployments are going to skyrocket over the next two to three years. The main business drivers for this revolve around customer engagement: to improve sales, customer service and marketing,” says Philip Carnelley, Research Director, Software, IDC Europe. A recent report by Accenture also highlighted that AI has the potential to double the annual economic growth rate in developed economies by 2035. It noted the significant role digital labor can have in speeding a revival in productivity and bridging the widening gap between the diminishing working age population and growing pension age population.\nBased out of Madrid, Javier Diaz will spearhead IPsoft’s penetration of the emerging AI market across Spain, Portugal and Latin America. Most recently, Diaz was regional VP at Salesforce. In France, Gerald Audenis, who was previously general manager for Automic Labs, joins as director of operations to drive deployment and delivery of Amelia across industries.\nIn the last year, IPsoft has experienced continued growth worldwide, and now has more than 30 cognitive deployments in production with some of the world’s leading brands. As a result, IPsoft has doubled the size of its headquarters center in New York to accommodate a larger team of business analysts and cognitive specialists working on global deployments of Amelia as well as a multi discipline research and development team.

The evolution of Amelia connects AI into the very heart of the enterprise and drives value all the way from front office to back office. Leveraging a unique combination of humanlike intelligence and machine powered analytics, Amelia will allow enterprises to scale customer interactions and transform end to end processes in order to become digital frontrunners.\nMultiple breakthroughs in Amelia’s cognitive capabilities have drastically advanced her ability to converse with her human counterparts in more than 40 languages in a completely natural, context aware dialogue. In parallel, new analytical capabilities allow her to enrich every user interaction with decisions based on real time data insights. Together these strengths make Amelia the only AI ready to excel in roles spanning the entire value chain for tomorrow’s digital winners. These roles range from servicing customer requests for new insurance policies and assessing risk profiles for new loan applicants to advising employees on HR policies and ensuring supplier billing matches contractual agreements.\n\nMore than 50 global organizations are already employing Amelia to improve customer experience and drive enhanced productivity. For example:\nAmelia is working on the IT service desk for one global telecoms provider to provide best in class support for employees. She has held more than 80,000 conversations to date, and resolved 69% of these queries end to end.\nIn the U.S., Amelia assists customers of a leading insurer access faster responses. She handles queries from more than 3,000 users per week and achieves 93% accuracy.\nIn Sweden, Amelia is helping a leading Nordic bank provide 24 x 7 access to its 4 million retail banking customers and resolving more than 85% of the queries addressed to her.\n\n“Across industries and geographies we are working with pioneering executives who are leading their organizations’ digital transformation by introducing advanced AI. They are motivated by a desire to achieve superior outcomes: increasing loyalty amongst customers, shrinking the time from product to distribution, eliminating inefficiencies within internal processes and creating opportunities for new revenue streams. Amelia represents an integral part of the new hybrid digital / human team they are putting in place to achieve these goals and seize competitive advantage,” said Chetan Dube, CEO, IPsoft.\nAmelia addresses the global demand from enterprises to implement AI before they are left behind in the race to turn digital. Recently, IDC projected worldwide revenues for AI and cognitive solutions will rise sharply from $8 billion in 2016 to more than $47 billion in 2020.\nA new AI model for enterprises\nThe broadening of Amelia’s capabilities marks a shift in how rapidly AI will impact enterprise operations. For the first time, businesses will have access to a single platform that integrates all the AI capabilities required to drive digital transformation. “Amelia not only turns transactions into conversations to enrich customer experience but also adds tremendous business value by leveraging the power and scale of machine learning, speed and analytics,” said Edwin van Bommel, Chief Cognitive Officer, IPsoft.\nAmelia’s five unique skillsets are:\n\nConversational intelligence – Amelia can interact with the most complex dialogues across any channel from voice to mobile and online chat. Even when customers switch between different requests in a conversation Amelia stays on track. Like a human, she thinks ahead to understand where conversations are heading and uses spread-activation to deliver quicker and more intelligent responses. As Amelia detects customers’ moods, she is also able to adapt the content of her responses and expressions to create a truly personal experience for each customer.\nAdvanced analytics – Through her new abilities to analyze data, Amelia generates business intelligence drawn from every interaction combined with data held in enterprise core systems. She uses advanced analytics like machine learning to assess large amounts of data and act on new insights allowing her to make real-time decisions that provide better outcomes.\nSmart workflow – Amelia is not limited to interacting with co-workers and customers but also integrates with enterprise systems like SAP and Oracle, allowing her to orchestrate the actions necessary to deliver complete outcomes and streamline execution of back-end processes.\nExperience management – Amelia is aware of the full context of every conversation so she can adapt her social tone and actions accordingly. She selects the most appropriate of her multiple knowledge engines at every step of the conversation to keep dialogue fluid and helps customers reach their goals faster. Instead of treating existing customers as strangers, Amelia uses facial recognition to begin new conversations with the full knowledge of all a customer’s previous contact history. Most importantly, when Amelia needs to escalate a call, she passes on all relevant information to her human colleagues so they can continue the conversation smoothly without forcing customers to repeat themselves.\nSupervised automated learning – Amelia has an expanded inventory of learning and self-learning tools to help her extract knowledge from large documents and historical records, making her easier than ever to train. She constantly improves performance and updates her knowledge base through advanced machine and deep learning to provide enterprises with faster time to value.\n\nTo learn more about how Amelia can transform business operations and customer interactions, visit amelia.com/amelia.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

The report, entitled “IPsoft’s Amelia: More Than a Chatbot,” reviews lessons learned by early adopters of Amelia and gives assurance that cognitive technology can increase commercial advantage and improve customer interactions in activities like banking, insurance, and mortgage processing.\nExpanding on the collective wisdom of executives presenting at IPsoft’s recent Digital Workforce Summit, the report offers over a dozen themes that should be considered by all first-time adopters of artificial intelligence. Insights drawn from Ovum’s analysis include:\n\nAmelia’s value lies not in quick cost savings, but more holistic changes to business processes. Ovum states, “Amelia’s suitability is more likely to be maximized when deployed as part of organizations’ broader strategic aims like improving the customer experience, or perhaps when enabling entirely different channels of user engagement – for example, voice-activated/headless user interfaces (HUIs) such as Amazon’s Alexa.\"\nEducating teams about the difference between chatbots and AI is an essential starting point so that SMEs at all levels can spot opportunities for the technology to make improvements.\nDeploying AI requires a different mix of skills than conventional software deployment. Ovum states, “Good teams have a mix of product, process and industry knowledge between them to tackle the individual processes competently.”\nEnsure clear KPIs are set out from the start to capture impact of AI and provide a foundation for building on early success.\n\nChetan Dube, President & CEO of IPsoft, remarks, “As Ovum notes, enterprises are integrating Amelia into their strategy in a variety of production roles, highlighting her ability to impact positively not one but multiple business areas within their organization. Compared to non-adopters of AI, trailblazing companies like these are better prepared for the wave of AI transformation that is set to take hold of both front and back office operations.”\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

The same device can be used to access an employee’s internal PTO systems to verify and book vacation time, without the additional time and burden of accessing multiple systems manually. This integration allows a continuous and unified user experience between consumer and business activities all on the same device, creating an omni-channel approach for companies using Amelia to service external customers and internal staff.\n“Now companies deploying Amelia, can benefit from accessing this increasingly popular home device channel without the need for additional process training. They can be sure of offering a unified experience to customers for home-life and business tasks,” said Edwin van Bommel, IPsoft’s Chief Cognitive Officer. “With full data visibility of how customers respond to different channels, organizations can also take control of their channel strategy and lead customers who begin an interaction on home devices to continue the conversation on the platforms they know are most effective in delivering a return on their investment.”\nThe market for in-home devices continues accelerate and is set to become a critical channel for customer experience. One survey1 estimates that more than 10 million Alexa-powered Amazon Echo devices have been sold in the US as of May 2017, and another study2 forecasts that 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-activated device like Echo or Google Home at least once a month this year.\nMultiple research studies show that customers want businesses to provide an integrated multi-channel customer experience, with an ability to access services on multiple devices wherever and whenever needed. With in-home devices becoming a mainstay in many people’s homes, users expect a high degree of ease-of-use to access services that cross their business and home lives for more timely and effective interactions. Meanwhile, companies that deploy Amelia for internal and external services can see their own business benefits, such as increased employee productivity, higher customer satisfaction, and stronger customer retention and relationships.\n1Consumer Intelligence Research Partners\n2eMarketer\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

Moch was recognized for spearheading projects with IPsoft’s Amelia to enhance bank operations and customer service. The award was presented to Moch at this year’s Constellation Research Supernova Gala, held on the last night of the analyst firm’s Connected Enterprise Summit at the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay, Calif.\nThe annual Supernova Awards were created to recognize the trailblazing exploits of individuals who have decided to introduce disruptive technology into their organizations. The awards are judged by a select group of thought-leaders, analysts and journalists who evaluate whether a finalist has skillfully deployed an emerging technology within their company’s business environment. Moch was among four finalists in his category, which covered progressive and innovative use of AI technologies for demonstrable company benefits.\nMoch has successfully introduced Amelia, IPsoft’s market-leading cognitive virtual agent, into SEB’s internal service desk and customer-facing operations, and is working on implementing Amelia into other business areas as well. Amelia handles external customer service requests for more than a million customers, with the goal to deliver the best-possible service experience. Currently, Amelia handles customer queries like password resets, step-by-step assistance with credit and debit cards, and banking location services. Amelia’s abilities are expanding to more complex tasks like ID verification, which takes place after an account-sensitive question is asked.\nIn her customer-facing role, Amelia has reached a 90% accuracy rate in understanding and completing tasks as well as correctly handing off queries to her human co-workers when necessary. Amelia has improved SEB’s service consistency through her 24/7 availability and multi-channel delivery, and overall has improved internal employee satisfaction as agents can now focus on more complicated, higher value tasks.\n“It’s important to think of the implementation process of cutting-edge technology as a learning journey first. Start with small, targeted use cases and generate some quick wins to begin garnering the support of your organization as a whole,” Moch said. “Our main objective with Amelia was to create a brand new channel where customers could have their inquiries resolved as quickly and effectively as possible on their own time.”\nEdwin van Bommel, Chief Cognitive Officer at IPsoft, said, “SEB is one of our pioneering clients, and Nicolas championed the use of Amelia in his organization. His leadership skills and intimate knowledge of SEB’s business operations were crucial in leading this AI project through to successful completion, with fantastic business results and improved service for SEB’s customers.

The award was presented Oct. 20 during an event at The Georgia Aquarium and attracted a sold-out audience of Georgia-based businesspeople and technology providers.\nThe TAG Excalibur Awards recognize organizations throughout the Georgia region for their ability to successfully implement business technology to solve complex challenges affecting their day-to-day operations. There are a total of five categories upon which competing organizations are grouped. This year’s nominees were separated into the following categories: Non-Profit, Small Company, Large-sized Company, Enterprise Company and finally Most Creative Solution, where IHG was declared the winner among several nominees.\nIHG’s effective deployment of Amelia, IPsoft’s market-leading cognitive virtual agent, within their global IT service desk has positively impacted quality of service by ensuring that only best-in-class responses are given to the queries of franchised hotel managers. One area of attention is the group’s reservation engine and property management system which plays a critical role in the smooth running of each hotel. Previously, support for such systems was distributed amongst several third-party entities. Through Amelia, IHG is centralizing all incoming requests and is reducing the call transfer fees incurred after service desk staff would contact the incorrect vendor as well as accelerate resolution times.\nIn addition to re-routing calls, Amelia is being taught how to answer higher-volume, end-user IT queries so that she can further relieve some of the workload pressure on her human colleagues on IHG’s IT Service Desk. At the current pilot phase, Amelia is achieving over 83% accuracy on received queries and is expanding the processes she can support. As an example, in just one month she has learned more than 50 new processes.\n“Amelia has been instrumental in elevating our IT Service Desk’s level of efficiency and we’re excited to expand the scope of her responsibilities to other use cases going forward,” said Scot Whigham, IHG’s Director of Global IT Service Support. “We’re honored to win this award because it embodies our commitment to constantly innovate and enhance the way we operate on a global scale to deliver high-quality end user service. It also sheds light on the bright minds we have working on our digital transformation within IHG and our greater community.”\nJonathan Crane, IPsoft’s Chief Commercial Officer, said, “We want to congratulate IHG on their TAG Excalibur Award for their pioneering use of Amelia in IT service desk operations.

This opens the door for a wide range of departments and agencies in the state to benefit from the efficiencies of IPsoft’s Autonomic IT Infrastructure Management platform, IPcenter, and the company’s market-leading cognitive virtual agent, Amelia.\nThe NSW Government is widely regarded as the most advanced Australian state and has repeatedly proven to be the only digital-ready state government, leading the country in seeking to implement cutting-edge technology within government operations and customer experience.\n“The GovDC Marketplace is focused on assisting government agencies to deliver fast, cost-effective and reliable solutions to NSW citizens through as-a-service and cloud capability solutions. Our pre-qualified suppliers are a vital part of that, with agencies able to choose the right solution for them based on the hybrid IT value proposition of each supplier,” said Simon Geraghty, Executive Director, NSW Government Technology Platforms, Department of Finance, Services and Innovation.\n“We see significant potential in helping government departments and agencies leverage breakthrough AI technology that will deliver a radically more efficient level of service to citizens. Amelia can transform internal and citizen-facing processes that require a conversationally-intelligent virtual agent to deliver an exceptional customer experience at scale,” said Andrew Winlaw, Vice President of IPsoft Australia & New Zealand. “We also see a huge opportunity to reduce resolution times and improve reliability within the IT infrastructure by leveraging IPcenter’s virtual engineers.”\nIPcenter is noted as the leader in IT operations automation by market analyst firm, Everest Group.

{"Title": "IPsoft Equips Businesses to Accelerate Digital Transformation at Scale by Automating Delivery of Enterprise Services with 1Desk™", "Date": "November 7, 2017 • 3 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nThe vastly increased automation of business processes enabled by 1Desk™ represents a radical shift in the operating model for enterprises.\n\n\n\n\n\n1Desk™, the world’s first AI platform to combine cognitive and autonomic technologies, will fully automate shared enterprise services\nNew York, November 7, 2017- IPsoft, the leader in enterprise AI, today announced its visionary new platform for business users, 1Desk™, that enables businesses to accelerate digital transformation and stay competitive in the digital economy. For the first time, enterprises will be able to draw on a digital labor pool of cognitive agents, virtual engineers and virtual administrators in order to automate entire end-to-end processes, from HR and IT, to Finance and Administration. Employees will no longer have to navigate multiple systems but instead channel all their requests and queries through a single cognitively-enabled interface to access a full suite of enterprise services 24-by-7.\nAlthough the average cost of Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses across industries sits at around 25% of sales1, this can be considerably higher in major industries including Financial Services (41%) and Healthcare (38%). The level of automation made possible by 1Desk™ could cut this to a fraction of the cost. At the same time, employee productivity is set to rise sharply as dedicated personal digital support will eliminate the time wasted by filling out cumbersome forms and waiting for routine tasks to be completed.\n“1Desk™ is the unified service desk that converges the front and back offices. It directly connects business users to the applications that service them, disintermediating large segments of IT and business operations. 1Desk™ improves the Net Promoter Scores not only for IT, but for HR, finance, helpdesk, facilities and administrative tasks. The big difference to 1Desk™ is that it has cognitive competence so it can understand business users directly, and service their requests through automated digital labor, not by armies of people,” said Chetan Dube, CEO of IPsoft.\nUniquely, 1Desk™ will be able to target the inefficiencies that lie in processes running across different functions. For example, the comprehensive process knowledge capabilities of Amelia, IPsoft's market-leading cognitive agent embedded in the 1Desk™ platform, can act as the glue to unify the implications of policy changes across all supporting enterprise systems by automatically updating intelligent workflows.\nIn the $6.3 trillion 2 race for digital renovation, manual processes have become a stumbling block for operational efficiency and market growth. Static point solutions that automate single steps in the process limit the speed of change that is required to compete with companies that were ‘born-digital’ as well as traditional competitors that are on a fast track to digital adoption. Through machine learning, 1Desk™ facilitates rapid improvement and industrializes a cycle of continuous improvement and learning from every interaction with business users. Exceptions that are managed by human engineers and administrators within 1Desk™ are recorded at all times so that a stream of new intelligent automation is generated, speeding up the ability to implement new efficiencies going forward.\nCarestream Health, a global provider of medical imaging systems and IT solutions, will be the first Beta customer for 1Desk™. “1Desk™ introduces AI innovation on a grand scale, opening up the possibility to set a new standard for cognitive-enabled business processes in terms of both speed and quality,” said Gerson Benker, Vice President of IT Operations at Carestream. “We are excited at the prospect of employing 1Desk™’s end-to-end automation capabilities within our strategy in order to provide an even better experience for our business users and customers.”\nThe vastly increased automation of business processes enabled by 1Desk™ represents a radical shift in the operating model for enterprise organizational models. In the future, the execution of tasks will be predominantly fulfilled by Digital Labor. Human talent will focus on managing and directing the further development of automation. IPsoft facilitates the creation of a Digital Labor Studio within organizations to orchestrate the rapid development of a continuously improving Digital Workforce. This unique hub of digital enablement talent will coordinate the work of automation engineers, data scientists, linguists, business analysts, user-experience designers and system integrators to deliver on the full value of 1Desk™.\n1Desk™ is created on a foundation of market-leading technology. Amelia is widely recognized as being at the forefront of conversational AI platforms and was recently described by industry analyst firm Ovum as being suitable for enabling entirely new customer channels. IPsoft’s autonomic technology has been spearheading transformation at scale for more than 15 years and is noted by research analyst Everest Group as the leader in IT automation.\n1 SG&A Benchmarks, Schonfield & Associates\n2 IDC Worldwide Semiannual Digital Transformation Spending Guide, May 2017\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

Forrester says IPsoft’s “corporate DNA” reflects its vast catalogue of thousands of automations, “but also how it conducts business.” The report notes a team of IPsoft engineers are focused on maintaining and building on the company’s standard operating procedures, and finds “use cases cover the spectrum from preemptive monitoring to SOPs [standard operating procedures] that execute over nondeterministic pathways to resolve incidents.”\nThe report, which covers several technology companies, SIs and consulting firms, highlights different automation solutions and discusses the different types of partnerships that are developing as automation adoption grows within enterprises.\n“Every major IT decision-maker understands that intelligent automation is the future of operations and it starts with doing a digital renovation of the existing environment. Companies should begin investing now,” said Allan Andersen, Director of Enterprise Solutions at IPsoft. “Intelligent automation is an art-form and requires a culture of continuous improvement and smart use of AI technologies.”\nThe Forrester report includes a review of the maturation of automation technology, the importance of technology partnerships, and what IT operations teams should consider when reevaluating existing contracts and relationships to include more automation investment.\nForrester’s report concludes that the initial proof-of-concept stage for automation technology has ended and the number of public reference cases is growing. These use cases remain narrow, and the results are still limited, the report states, but enterprises must work now to determine how they can make the best use of automation.\nFor more information about the Forrester report, go to this link.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

UK business is wasting an estimated £6.9bn in salary costs while staff are hindered or unproductive for over seven days a year as a result of IT failures.\nThe study finds business users calling for a simpler way of having IT issues resolved, with 66% stating it should be as simple as asking \"Siri\" a question. In an age of digital transformation, it is more important than ever for technology to accelerate the pace of doing business. In 2018, this will take the form of more IT automation, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence.\nThe study shows the need for more intelligent systems as business users still have IT issues that hamper their productivity for more than 52 hours a year – equating to more than six full working days. Furthermore, each user loses 15 hours a year due to IT issues completely preventing them from doing their job – equating to nearly two full working days.\nBrand loyalty is vital for business success, yet in the last 12 months, 58% of all respondents to the study had an IT issue that prevented them from providing service to a customer. Additionally, half of the respondents had an IT issue that caused them to miss a deadline. In an attempt to stay productive, 42% of users would rather try to find a workaround instead of contacting IT to fix their problem, with 33% asking their colleagues if they know how to fix the issue before approaching IT.\nAccording to a new survey commissioned by IPsoft, IT issues impacting productivity equate to an estimated £62.4bn in revenue.\nChetan Dube, CEO, IPsoft, said, “IT is both the accelerator for digital transformation and paradoxically the stumbling block for digital strategies. These findings show that business users want an all-together different experience from their interactions with IT and the processes it supports. Business users want to be able to talk to their IT applications and have the applications solve their problems or requests, thereby disintermediating large segments of classic IT operations and ticket generating systems.”\nBusiness users prefer to speak through their IT issues in simple language, and often try to find work-arounds to the formal procedures IT departments have in place to fix their issues. Users say they find it easier to verbally describe their IT issues rather than write them down (51%). Nearly half (49%) of respondents feel their IT requests go into a black hole and they want to be kept better informed of progress. Furthermore, 64% feel frustrated if their work IT systems are down for just five minutes. The survey also shows that more than half of respondents have greater problems with their work IT systems than the ones they use in their personal lives (57%).\n“We are addressing these issues through the launch of 1Desk™, which layers cognitive competence on top of an autonomic backbone to provide business users with an intelligent interface to a digital agent who can diagnose problems, fulfil requests and execute tasks across shared services functions including IT, HR, finance. No matter which channel business users find most convenient– messenger tools, phone, online chat – using simple, plain language we ensure end-to-end automation provides them quick turnaround times and delivers high NPS satisfaction scores,” concluded Chetan Dube, CEO, IPsoft.\nMethodology:\nThe study, carried out by independent research house 3Gem, surveyed 3,000 respondents working at organizations with 250+ UK employees.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

{"Title": "Transformative Customer Experience (TCX) Will Be Critical for Businesses in 2018", "Date": "December 19, 2017 • 3 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nNew IPsoft White Paper Identifies How Companies Can Leverage Cognitive Technologies for Competitive Edge.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, Dec. 19, 2017 — Transformative Customer Experience, or TCX, powered by automation, cognitive and AI technologies, will be a key differentiator for all enterprises, according to a new white paper from IPsoft, the leader in enterprise AI. The report urges all businesses, regardless of size or industry, to build TCX into their future investment plans to ensure they get closer to their customers and keep pace with the competition.\nCustomer experience is at the top of the agenda for C-level executives worldwide for one simple reason: companies with high customer satisfaction ratings consistently outperform their rivals. Studies have shown that effective customer experience translates to greater loyalty, higher revenues and superior long-term growth, and companies that fail to deliver a world-class customer experience will lose out to competitors. The white paper highlights that the battle to provide immediate access to an agent 24/7 is only the starting point of the journey. In their adoption of AI, executives need to demand that their virtual employees provide a human quality conversation and be equipped to resolve issues independently.\nAs the company behind Amelia, the market-leading cognitive virtual agent, IPsoft has an implicit understanding of how technology can fundamentally transform the customer experience, making every interaction more natural, conversational, effective and enduring. TCX is not something that can be achieved overnight, but pioneering companies are already making investments to transform and improve how they serve their customers, and gaining real business benefits as a result.\nfile_downloadDownload White Paper\nCompanies know that an ability to deliver immediate customer experience 24/7 is a baseline requirement, and is absolutely critical for any successful engagement strategy because customers won’t wait. However, if a customer quickly reaches customer support, and then has a negative experience (like being put on hold or waiting endlessly in an online queue), any customer goodwill gained from that 24/7 connection is lost. If companies don’t have the necessary technology to take advantage of interacting with customers 24/7, it doesn’t matter how fast or quick customers can connect. Cognitive platforms, meanwhile, allow companies to augment 24/7 capabilities by scaling with changes in demand for instant access through customers’ favorite channels, even at peak demand times.\nIn addition to 24/7 capabilities, cognitive platforms can deliver much more for enterprises. In the white paper, IPsoft argues that to implement a true TCX strategy, enterprises need a platform with three core elements that can only be delivered through investments in AI and cognitive technologies. In all instances, TCX is:\n\nIntelligent. Customers expects real conversations. Virtual agents like Amelia not only understand what end-users say but also what they mean, providing a better user experience that requires a minimal amount of repetition or clarification. Amelia’s emotional intelligence, with her ability to detect mood and sentiment, means a more human-like experience for customers.\n\n\nIntimate. Customers expects personal treatment. Cognitive platforms and virtual agents are designed to deliver a more intimate customer experience, primarily because they can speak as a customer speaks. IPsoft’s Amelia can interact with users in 40 languages using natural language processing (NLP), while deep neural networks (DNN) and machine learning (ML) allow her to understand how humans speak and interact, providing more personalized interaction.\n\n\nIntegrated. Customers want resolutions. While many enterprises offer multiple customer support channels, cognitive technologies allow interactions to be passed from one channel to another without loss of quality or intent, so an inquiry submitted in one channel can be answered in another. By integrating agents fully with back-end systems and processes, companies can dramatically speed up resolution time and ensure customers leave the conversation fully satisfied.\n\n“With customer expectations continuing to rise, it’s more important than ever for enterprises to adopt an effective customer experience strategy, and deliver truly personalized and differentiated conversations at scale,” said Allan Andersen, IPsoft’s Director of Enterprise Solutions. “Cognitive technologies enable companies to provide an intimate, intelligent and integrated experience, one that is always on and available 24/7, and that is capable of inspiring customer loyalty.”\nTCX is not a trend for the future. As outlined in the white paper, TCX is already here and should be considered an immediate imperative for the enterprise. Companies must realize that if they don’t take steps to implement TCX, the competition surely will.\nTo learn more about TCX, and to see examples of how IPsoft’s cognitive technology is transforming the customer experience, download the white paper here.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

Allstate, the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the US, first deployed Amelia last September, and since then she has collaborated with Allstate live agents on more than 3 million calls. Working through a conversational chat-based interface, Amelia leads agents through step-by-step procedures on a variety of support issues, including policy details and policyholder information. If a customer called Allstate in the past six months with a service question, it’s more than likely that the call center agent was chatting with Amelia in the background to collaboratively find an answer. Instead of putting a customer on hold to consult databases or spreadsheets, or transferring a customer to another co-worker, Allstate agents can ask Amelia questions via chat, and work together to find a solution.\nAmelia is trained on almost 40 different insurance topics for Allstate. She has lowered call duration from 4.6 to 4.2 minutes – and when you’re a company with millions of customers like Allstate, every second counts. Amelia also has reduced the need for a follow-up call; since she was hired, 75% of inquiries have been solved during the first call, compared with 67% prior to Amelia’s hiring. In one month alone Amelia assisted on almost 250,000 calls.\nBut what we’re most proud of is this: 99% of Allstate agents who worked with Amelia said they were completely satisfied with their interactions with her. This is exactly the kind of human-machine collaboration we imagined when we designed Amelia, and we know she’s generating similar satisfaction levels among our other customers too.\n“She’s a pretty great example of a digital colleague that has a lot of capabilities,” Carla Zuniga, senior vice president of operations at Allstate, told The Wall Street Journal. “It’s reduced some of the complexity for our customer service representatives by giving them better and quicker access to information policies and procedures.”\n“It’s a good blend of human intelligence and problem-solving with technology,” she said. We couldn’t agree more.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/amelia-and-allstate-in-the-wall-street-journal/", "Role": ""},

An HfS survey shows that more than one-third of C-Suite executives (37% of survey respondents) expect cognitive technologies to reduce cost. Cognitive agents ranked as a top investment priority for enterprises; 32% of executives said they are currently involved in pilot projects. In addition, C-level executives at more mature enterprises already have started to break down siloes with cognitive solutions, and also are focused on creating better customer experiences through cognitive technology, the research shows.\nThe report identifies IPsoft’s 1Desk™ as an example of a solution that can connect front and back offices for greater customer centricity. 1Desk™ combines the power of Amelia, IPsoft’s digital AI colleague who can interact with both external customers and internal employees, with a newly developed autonomic backbone based on IPsoft’s IPcenter. 1Desk™ can execute business processes quickly and efficiently across IT, HR, finance, and administrative support. HfS Research interviewed several IPsoft customers piloting 1Desk™ as part of this research.\n“1Desk™ is the unified service desk that converges front and back offices. It directly connects business users to the applications that service them, disintermediating large segments of IT and business operations. 1Desk™ improves user satisfaction scores not only for IT support, but for HR, finance, helpdesk, and administrative tasks. The big difference to 1Desk™ is that it has cognitive competence with Amelia, who can understand business users directly, and service their requests through automated digital labor,” said Chetan Dube, CEO of IPsoft.\nFour major enterprises currently implementing Amelia and/or 1Desk within their customer service organizations were interviewed for the research, along with 100 C-level executives who responded to a web- and phone-based survey.\nReport author Melissa O’Brien, Research Director, Customer Engagement Strategies at HfS, shared that “the ability to predict customer expectations and act on them is essential for getting ahead in today’s global digital economy. Increasingly, business leaders are looking to break down the barriers within their organizations to support the digital experiences of their customers. Our study found that executives are looking to cognitive technologies to provide the glue that connects the business operations to the end customer. Leveraging better quality data from smart cognitive technologies ultimately translates to competitive advantage.”\nPhil Fersht, CEO and Chief Analyst at HfS and co-author of the report, added, “We have to collapse these legacy internal silos which impede business operations supporting the needs of customers, as they occur in real-time. Front and back offices are ceasing to exist for successful firms – they simply rely on OneOffice to stay ahead of their markets.”\nThe complimentary report is available for download on the HfS Research website, or at Amelia.com.\nDownload Report\n \nAbout HfS Research\nHfS’ mission is to provide visionary insight into the major innovations impacting business operations: automation, artificial intelligence, blockchain, digital business models and smart analytics.\nWe focus on the future of operations across key industries.

Amelia, a market-leading artificial intelligence platform created by New York-based technology company IPsoft, now assists call center staff to improve the overall customer experience.\nAllstate deployed Amelia as a test in September and, to date, has used the platform in more than 3 million customer conversations. With an instant message interface, Amelia leads call center employees through step-by-step procedures to help answer a variety of customer questions, including policy and policyholder information.\n“Amelia is quickly becoming an important component of our customer service strategy,” said Allstate Senior Vice President Carla Zuniga. “She provides our call center personnel with the information and procedures they need to address our customers’ questions and concerns.”\nAmelia’s machine learning capability allows her to improve her ability to answer customer questions by “listening” to interactions she doesn’t understand and with Allstate experts’ help quickly expanding her knowledge.\nThis AI colleague knows more than 40 industry-specific topics and, because of access to Amelia, newer representatives need less time for training. Amelia can also help keep all employees in compliance with industry regulations. For instance, call center reps are not allowed to process address changes for policyholders in certain states. In this situation, Amelia can provide the information on the proper procedure, and the employee can quickly hand off the session to a licensed colleague.\n“We congratulate Allstate for their pioneering use of AI with their first Amelia deployment,” said IPsoft’s CEO Chetan Dube. “Customer service is a strategic imperative for Allstate, and Amelia possesses intelligent and interactive capabilities that are helping the company achieve its support goals.

The report, Workplace Evolution: Empowering Employees in a Flexible Work Environment, examines the changing modern workforce and how companies are responding to evolving worker needs.\nIn addition to focusing on workforce themes such as office design, human resources (HR) policies, and recruitment, the report also examines automation and how workers will be impacted. “When thinking about the future of the workplace, many people envision robot assistants and virtual reality meetings in self-driving cars,” the report states. “It is true that technology has been the underlying force driving changes in the way people work. Advances in mobile technology allow people to work on laptops at home or from a local café; meetings can be conducted remotely over increasingly effective video-conferencing systems; huge quantities of data can be shared between people over great distances.”\nThe Economist references Artificial Intelligence’s (AI) promise mostly for its “ability to scan an organization’s networks and use machine learning to make business decisions (and understand their impact) using real-time data, including conversations. These can be used to manage tasks from fielding telephone calls to allocating resources on projects.”\nAmelia, specifically, is referenced as a workplace application of AI that can be adopted across sectors to change the future of work. IPsoft Chief Commercial Officer Jonathan Crane explained in the report some of the benefits of employing a digital colleague such as Amelia. “If most queries boil down to the same six points then why can’t you answer them automatically?” Crane asks.\nWhat the report alludes to, but doesn’t fully explore, is Amelia’s role as a ghost or whisper agent. Amelia will not only revolutionize the workplace by automating repetitive tasks, she will also serve as a collaborator who can find answers to questions, run reports, and even make decisions for human workers.\nWithin IPsoft’s 1Desk, Amelia works with an end-to-end IT operations management platform designed to make workers’ lives easier and allow them to do their jobs more efficiently.  With 1Desk, Amelia can become the first line of support for IT helpdesk questions. For example: If an employee can’t remember his or her VPN password, normally the employee would send an email to IT support, which gets put into a long queue for servicing. With 1Desk, an employee can simply send a chat message to Amelia, who can then pull up the VPN password immediately, and reset it if necessary. This kind of capability is important given the global nature of many companies’ employee footprint, with workers operating in corporate offices, at client sites and in their own homes. The Economist report stated that employees doing at least part of their work from home has surged by 115% since 2005.\nWe agree with The Economist report’s assertion that AI will play a fundamental role in transforming today’s workforce. 1Desk can play an integral part in that transformation for any company, connecting front- and back-office systems through automation and using Amelia as workers’ go-to source for internal support, services and information.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/the-economist-names-amelia-as-a-disruptive-workplace-technology/", "Role": ""},

Read this article to find out more.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmelia Helps Clients Solve Business Issues\nA recent Computer Weekly (subscription required) article examines the complexities of IPsoft’s Amelia and the work IPsoft does for its clients. The piece describes Amelia as “something like the HAL 9000 in the science fiction classic 2001: A Space Odyssey,” (before Hal went rogue, of course). “This type of digital worker in enterprises holds the promise of cutting costs and improving productivity dramatically,” the author Karl Flinders writes.\nWhat’s especially valuable about the Computer Weekly article is the deft delineation the author draws for readers between Amelia and other AI systems. “The ability to understand and respond to natural language is one of Amelia’s selling points,” Flinders writes. “Imagine Amazon’s chatbot Alexa or Apple’s Siri solving complex IT issues or completing important business processes, rather than turning the lights off or explaining Faraday’s law of induction and then telling you the capital of the Turks and Caicos Islands.”\n\nThe ability to understand and respond to natural language is one of Amelia’s selling points.\n— Karl Flinders, Computer Weekly\n\nThis is a crucial point that bears repeating. Amelia is a digital colleague designed to handle business tasks on her own. We don’t view her as an assistant or a bot. When she’s hired by a company she’s there to serve an important role, just like a human hire would be. She’s trained to speak and respond with appropriate human emotion, and she’s adept at gauging emotion to ensure that she uses proper empathy when engaging with angry or frustrated customers. Amelia is a taskmaster that can be trained in a variety of financial services, insurance, and healthcare roles. You won’t find that level of complexity among any of the consumer AI that have become the mass media focal points within our industry.\nAmelia Helps Clients Solve Business Issues\nTo further this delineation, Flinders details the wide range of work Amelia does for clients, such as Spanish bank BBVA, insurance giant AIG, and mobile network operator Vodafone. He describes Amelia as “a banker, a tech expert, an HR manager or whatever a business wants it to be.”\nThe author focuses specifically on Amelia’s role at Vodafone, where she is available in seven countries of operation in three languages. Currently, 58% of contact to its IT services desk goes through Amelia.\n“Right now, we have 20,000 chats with Amelia a month and 53% of chats are completed by Amelia without any human intervention and in the others, Amelia hands over to a human agent,” Karen Brunet, Technology Shared Services Director at Vodafone, tells Computer Weekly. “We believe that, in the next few months, we are going to increase this autonomy and think we will be closer to 65% completed by Amelia.”\nWe suggest you read the entire Computer Weekly article, which tackles many more important issues, such as the role of AI systems in healthcare, the future of AI spending, which vertical industries are likely to adopt AI the fastest, and more.

These technologies also present exciting new opportunities for global development as described in the DWS presentation by Grete Faremo, the Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UNOPS.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI is transforming the UN’s approach to global development\nForbes reported on DWS 2018 and the many discussions during the event on the impact that Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Amelia are having and will have on the world. The enterprise space has been animated by AI’s potential to add business value through the automation of processes all along the value chain, whether physical, transactional or increasingly, cognitive. While AI has business leaders reimagining how a modern enterprise can operate, the potential impact on global development might be just as substantial.\nA tool for transformation\nDWS 2018 attracted experts from a wide spectrum of backgrounds to discuss the current and future effects of AI. Taking center stage was IPsoft’s digital colleague Amelia, who some visitors had a chance to interact directly with at our new AI laboratory Amelia City. “Seeing [Amelia in] action during live demonstration,” the author Roger Aitken wrote, “was something – responding to human queries within only slightly more time than a blink of an eye via text or voice.”\nThe commentary mentioned several examples where Amelia is already making a business impact, including implementations with the Japanese ICT firm NTT Communications (where she is known at “COTOHA”) and Spanish bank BBVA. Beyond companies’ bottom lines, Forbes highlighted discussions from DWS about how these technologies will benefit workers, noting “[research firm] Gartner’s prognosis has suggested that starting in 2020, AI-related job creation will ‘cross into positive territory’ and reach two million net-new jobs in 2025.”\n\nSeeing [Amelia in] action during live demonstration was something — responding to human queries within only slightly more time than a blink of an eye via text or voice.\n— Roger Aitken, Forbes\n\nBesides discussions around AI’s use within vertical industries, AI’s potential for the developing world was highlighted in a presentation at DWS by Grete Faremo, the Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS).\nThe Forbes piece noted how Faremo’s team is excited about the potential of “frontier technologies” such as Amelia to support their work. In 2015, the UN laid out 17 sustainable development goals, including 169 targets the group hopes to address by 2030. This ambitious agenda will require billions (if not trillions) of dollars in investments to overcome by using current technology. “This is why we are looking closely at the opportunities and challenges,” Faremo said. And this, she went on to explain, is where the disruptive power of AI might prove most impactful.\n“Standing here today from the UN, when I hear others talk, I immediately jump to the role AI could play to help accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,” Faremo told the DWS audience. “This is my focus. And it should be yours too.”\nIn addition to empowering developing communities to help themselves with the help of cognitive assistants, the piece noted Faremo’s optimism that AI will also be a powerful tool for collecting and processing data. Specifically, she noted how the UN could these technologies can predict the path of storms and track the spread of diseases, both of which acutely affect developing communities.\n“Whatever AI tools governments, policymakers and humanitarian organizations use,” Faremo noted, “it's important to use them where they'll do the most good.”\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/dws-2018-forbes-comments-on-ais-potential-for-good/", "Role": ""},

With 1Desk, employees will no longer need to navigate multiple shared systems and departments, and can interact with a single, cognitively-enabled interface to access their company’s full suite of enterprise services.\n“1Desk converges cognitive front-end with autonomic back-end to bring the first end-to-end automation solution,\" said Chetan Dube, CEO, IPsoft. \"It directly connects the business users with the applications that service them, thereby disintermediating human middleware and significantly improving turnaround times.”\n\nAmelia is becoming a catalyst, driving the digital\nOneOffice experience with intelligent digital processes.\n— Phil Fersht, CEO and Chief Analyst at HfS\n\nPhil Fersht, CEO and Chief Analyst at HfS and co-author of a recent report on using cognitive technology to connect users with business operations, said, “Amelia is becoming a catalyst, driving the digital OneOffice experience with intelligent digital processes. We have to collapse these legacy internal silos which impede business operations supporting the needs of customers, as they occur in real-time. Front and back offices are ceasing to exist for successful firms — they simply rely on OneOffice to stay ahead of their markets.”\nWith 1Desk, an autonomic framework intelligently executes complex tasks across business areas in order to satisfy high-level commands, which are provided through Amelia’s natural language interface. Employees and users speak normally to Amelia, as they would any other colleague, including questions and requests such as, “Why is my expense report not being paid?” or “Please install Office 365 on my laptop.”\n1Desk not only connects existing systems, it represents an entire new paradigm that upends traditional notions of enterprise UX. Several new innovations are featured in 1Desk allowing for dynamic, seamless integration between the cognitive layering and the underlying autonomic infrastructure:\n\nFully Qualified Tasks (FQTs) enable Amelia to always be compliant with the latest policies and regulatory protocols. If changes are made to the process for completing a task, Amelia automatically recognizes the differences and dynamically changes the dialogue.\n\n\nThe Cognitive OS (CogOS) empowers Amelia to communicate asynchronously and in a multi-threaded fashion, so tasks which requires several individual interactions over a period of time can be executed seamlessly and without human involvement. \n\n\nClarifying QA (CQA) allows Amelia to disambiguate similar requests to quickly identify the correct path, e.g. a user may say that they are having issues with the mail system, so Amelia will utilize CQA to discern which problems the user may be encountering, and then take steps to address the issue.\n\n1Desk reinvents the employee relationship with enterprise systems and maximizes productivity by removing silos and modernizing access to legacy backend systems. By bridging the gaps between business areas and automating tasks, employees are freed to maximize their creative and soft skills, as companies are able to reduce inefficiencies in order to build a path towards accelerated growth.\nFor IT support and IT operations, 1Desk re-imagines how a fully automated system can be built and maintained. The platform combines IT operations management with IT service management and IT process automation. With 1Desk, IPsoft introduces automated continuous improvement based on machine learning. Whenever human engineers or support staff manually fix issues, 1Desk actively monitors and extracts data from the activities they perform to improve its actions in the future.\nFor more information about 1Desk, please visit: https://amelia.ai/aiops\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

{"Title": "IPsoft London Presentation on AI’s Impact on Customer Experience Profiled in Teiss", "Date": "July 26, 2018 • 2 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nAn AI event in London sponsored by IPsoft and Business Reporter magazine was profiled by Teiss, the UK-based cyber security website. \n\n\n\n\n\nAutomation is reinventing the customer experience\nUK-based cyber security website TEISS profiled a recent IPsoft event in London that gathered senior executives from many sectors to discuss a wide range of issues regarding Artificial Intelligence’s (AI’s) impact on business, with an emphasis on Customer Experience (CX).\nThe Business Reporter Breakfast Briefing, held at The Ritz Hotel, was headlined by IPsoft Fellow Mark Minevich. Attendees from numerous industries shared examples of how AI is reinventing processes in their industry. For example, a delegate from the oil and gas sector reported that “his company was using AI to improve drilling operations.” However, much of the presentation centered on how advanced digital colleagues like Amelia are reinventing and improving CX.\n“AI offers a solution here because it can take some of the strain of customer interaction and resolve their problems more quickly or with less effort,” noted the author Shane Richmond. “For many customers, carrying out a simple transaction using their favourite chat app is more convenient than dialing a call centre or logging-on to a website.” Indeed, Amelia’s backend integrations and advanced Natural Language Interface (NLI) are being used by companies across numerous industries to make their help centers more versatile, accessible, and efficient.\nIn addition to the many opportunities presented by AI, there were also discussions about challenges, specifically when it comes a lack of AI understanding among senior leadership which can make projects hard to initiate. “Attendees agreed that companies will need people within the business who can identify new technologies and suggest where they might be applied,” Richmond wrote.\nThe event also touched on longer-term issues such as how to manage and counter employee anxieties about AI’s impact on their jobs. “While it’s possible that AI will lead to some reduction in the number of call centre staff,” the author noted, “attendees were keen to point out that a key role for AI in customer experience is to free-up call centre staff to deal with high value transactions, whether that’s handling unusual customer problems or dealing with the needs of important customers.”\nRegardless of how users, employees or companies feel about automating CX, AI will only accelerate this trend throughout different industries. As the author notes: “What is clear is that customer experience is on the brink of an AI revolution but it will take time and experimentation. AI adoption is a journey that a lot of companies are now starting out on.”\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsoft-london-presentation-on-ais-impact-on-customer-experience-profiled-in-teiss/", "Role": ""},
{"Title": "Computer Weekly Highlights Amelia’s Potential to ‘Augment Human Productivity’", "Date": "August 2, 2018 • 2 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nComputer Weekly recently profiled IPsoft’s industry-leading cognitive AI, Amelia and how she is defining the future of work and human productivity. \n\n\n\n\n\nComputer Weekly recently published a thorough examination of Artificial Intelligence’s (AI’s) potential to reinvent the workplace. The feature, titled “How Robot Workers Can Augment Human Productivity” (sign-in required), prominently featured IPsoft and Amelia our industry-leading cognitive agent.\nAuthor Karl Flinders details how AI is currently impacting industries around the world, before focusing on how cognitive technologies are now automating tasks that were once purely the domain of human workers.\n“One example is IPsoft’s cognitive agent Amelia, which can be a banker, a tech expert, an HR manager, or whatever a business wants it to be,” Flinders writes. “The AI platform can now answer questions and solve problems ranging from technical issues to employees’ holiday requests described to it in natural language, whether it be verbally or through text.”\nThe piece explores how Amelia’s industry-leading Natural Language Interface (NLI) allows enterprises to automate the user experience (UX), while her backend integrations empower her to execute complex tasks at machine speed. This combination of decreased overhead costs via the automated UX, and amplified productivity through the automation of complex workflows is a potent recipe for accelerated business value\nAs an example of the transformation made possible by “digital workers,” Flinders highlights the presentation by Vodafone’s Director of Technology Shared Services Karine Brunet at this year’s Digital Workforce Summit. Vodafone initially “hired” Amelia to automate many of its internal IT service tasks several years ago, and has since expanded her scope to seven countries and three languages. Brunet commented at DWS that Amelia handles around 20,000 user chats per month, 53% of which are completed without any human intervention, though she predicted that the company would be increasing that autonomy to 65% “in the next few months.” Most importantly, the article highlighted Brunet’s observation that “the company achieved a return on its investment in Amelia through savings in just 24 months.”\nThe piece also reviews the potential disruption AI may have on the human workforce. In the short- and medium-term future, many roles handled by humans may become obsolete as machines successfully replicate highly regimented tasks. However, Flinders mentions the long-term outlook for human workers in the era of AI is far more positive.\n“[T]he promise of AI creating many new jobs is a positive counter-argument,” Flinders writes. “According to Gartner, by 2020, AI will create more jobs than it eliminates. Humans have to train Amelia to work, after all, and by freeing up humankind from mundane tasks, who knows what future roles will be needed? According to a US Department of Labor report, 65% of today’s schoolchildren will eventually do jobs that don’t yet exist, with software robots as colleagues doing the mundane work.”\nAs Flinders notes, AI technologies will augment the human workforce.  In the future, machines will execute the highly regimented (and frankly, boring) tasks while people take on roles requiring uniquely human qualities such as creativity and emotional intelligence. The workplaces of tomorrow will be hybrid partnerships of digital and human employees working together to achieve new levels of productivity.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/computer-weekly-highlights-amelias-potential-to-augment-human-productivity/", "Role": ""},

Enterprises that improve EX are found to be “four times more profitable than those that don’t,” according to Everest Group.\nSource: Everest Group\n“While individually these [AI] technologies offer value, the real impact on EX and ultimately business value — comes from bringing them together. Together, these technologies support a next-generation workforce,” the white paper states.\nThe report provides examples of how AI technologies can be used in several employee workplace scenarios to improve EX, and the associated business benefits. The paper also showcases a leading hotel company that uses IPsoft’s Amelia as a virtual agent to quickly resolve employee IT service desk queries. The implementation of Amelia resulted in more than an 80 percent reduction in the time taken for identity authentication, and a 30 percent increase in first contact call resolution. Results like these leads to faster IT service for employees, who can avoid losing time on dealing with IT support issues and instead remain focused on their jobs.\nImproving Employee Experience with IPsoft’s 1Desk\nThe AI technologies highlighted in the Everest Group report are part of IPsoft’s 1Desk platform, which is designed to improve EX by driving end-to-end efficiencies within an organization, and by removing unnecessary and time-consuming steps from cumbersome internal service systems.\n“Everest Group has provided further confirmation that AI technologies will power radically different business operations through fully automated end-to-end processes,” said IPsoft CEO Chetan Dube. “Just as our products can deliver revolutionary experiences to external customers, 1Desk can bring new efficiencies and time savings to enterprise employees at a scale never before possible.”\nAmelia is the conversational interface for 1Desk, allowing employees to speak and chat in natural language and quickly receive support for HR, Finance, IT and other issues. Virtual engineers work with human colleagues to identify patterns and create new automated processes that are infinitely scalable, and that can complete repetitive tasks efficiently.\nWith 1Desk’s automation and cognitive interface, employees can quickly execute business processes, and continue with their work without logging a ticket, consulting an employee handbook or manual, or waiting in a help desk queue. “Organizations should take advantage of AI’s capability in creating a work environment that supports broader corporate goals of increased employee satisfaction, product/service speed-to-market, improved customer experience and loyalty, and faster revenue growth,” the white paper states.\nEverest Group previously rated IPsoft as the leader in IT operations automation.\nSource: Everest Group\nAbout Everest Group\nEverest Group is a consulting and research firm focused on strategic IT, business services, and sourcing.

Forbes profiled the ongoing successes of this partnership via an interview with Allstate Senior Vice President Carla Zuniga. \n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Allstate, the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the US, hired Amelia as a whisper agent to collaborate with human agents on customer support interactions. Amelia provides her human colleagues with personalized step-by-step procedures on more than 50 support issues delivered through a conversational chat-based user interface (UI). The successful partnership was recently highlighted by Forbes in an article titled, “Using AI for Customer Experience At Allstate.”\nThe feature, based on a podcast interview between contributor Blake Morgan and Allstate Senior Vice President Carla Zuniga, detailed some of the benefits delivered by Amelia (you can listen to in full conversation here). “Allstate employees can quickly chat with Amelia to get concise answers about complicated insurance questions from customers,” Morgan writes. “Not only does it allow customers to get the answers they need right away, but it allows employees to be ready to work much sooner by cutting down training time.”\nAs an added benefit, the article highlights how this human-AI partnership can ensure speedy compliance with government regulations — a particularly vital benefit in the insurance industry. As Morgan notes, “Amelia provides the best of both worlds — the quickness and accuracy of AI mixed with the personal touch of human interaction.”\nAccording to Zuniga, Amelia is currently utilized by more than 75% of Allstate call center employees to handle more than 250,000 conversations each month, and she has greatly reduced average call times while expanding its first-call resolution rates. (A recent Wall Street Journal profile of the Allstate’s AI project highlighted that 99% of Allstate agents who worked with Amelia said they were “completely satisfied” with their interactions.)\nBut this is only the first step in Allstate’s automation journey. The author notes that “Allstate has plans to increase her workload and expand her scope to eventually interact directly with customers.”\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/forbes-highlights-allstates-ongoing-success-with-amelia/", "Role": ""},

These technologies also work alongside humans to amplify productivity. Regardless of the scope of deployment, cognitive technologies are making an impact on the human workforce, a development recently highlighted in a feature by BBC reporter Chris Baraniuk.\nThe feature included commentary from IPsoft CEO Chetan Dube, who discussed Amelia’s impact on today’s workforce, particularly on call centers, but also laid out predictions for more ambitious forms of automation. \"I want to be able to have [Amelia] process my mortgage,\" Dube said. \"Can she do a risk analysis for me, can she process my credit card consolidation request?\" .\nA Look at What’s Next\nMoving forward, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies will continue to evolve and execute increasingly complex tasks. This doesn’t mean that humans will become obsolete. Just the opposite in fact. According to Gartner research, AI will begin creating more jobs than it eliminates by 2020 — a trend that will only accelerate from there.\nAs machines take over routine (and frankly, mundane) tasks, human employees are freed to emphasize uniquely human tasks such as creative problem solving and soft skills (i.e. person-to-person communication skills). For example, an experienced and knowledgeable customer service representative with high emotional intelligence will be freed from high-volume, low-level customer needs and be able to assist far more customers than would be previously possible. While there may be a transition period in which human workers are re-skilled for new roles, cognitive agents like Amelia will make human workers more valuable.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/bbc-highlights-amelias-potential-to-reimagine-human-productivity/", "Role": ""},

However, companies have yet to embrace Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool for thwarting attacks and safeguarding business processes that are ripe for exploitation. A thought-provoking piece on these subjects by IPsoft Solution Architect Joe Michael is featured in Professional Security Magazine Online.\nIn his op-ed, Michael examines the reasons in which businesses should include AI into their overall operations strategy — especially for security-based processes. He cites two crucial IPsoft case studies, during which our digital colleague Amelia turned basic interactions into an added layer of security.\nIn the case of an online gaming company, Amelia prevented phishing attacks by verifying gamers’ identities at the start of customer service calls. She was able to detect that 4% of all chats were phishing attempts, and she was able to stop those calls from ever reaching a human agent.\nCarestream Health deployed Amelia as a means to automate hardware and software delivery to its employees.

Unfortunately, this means a reduction in overall productivity. AI can help solve this issue. Read this article to find out more.\n\n\n\n\n\nIPsoft believes that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can make workers and companies more productive. Because AI automates routine tasks, workers are able to handle complex issues, retrieve information quickly, and focus on revenue-generating projects. But can these benefits add up to a nationwide increase in productivity?\nMartin Linstrom, Managing Director of the UK and Ireland at IPsoft, states in an op-ed on TechNative that automating basic IT services via digital colleagues such as IPsoft’s Amelia would help increase productivity in the UK. Linstrom believes that AI can enable employees to resolve minor issues quickly and without assistance, which would subsequently allow them to get back to more important tasks.\n“No-one should claim that [AI] is the sole panacea to the UK’s productivity slip, but applying AI to this single problem [IT resolution] could save millions of hours and billions of pounds a year, and re-position the UK at the forefront of worldwide manufacturing output,” Linstrom writes.\nThe problems, argue Linstrom, are as follows: Workers in the UK wait too long to speak to overstretched IT staff to resolve issues. They can’t perform other tasks because finding resolutions to their problems requires them to halt other work. Employees are missing deadlines and, on average, IT failures within large enterprises render employees completely unable to do their jobs nearly two working days a year (15 hours a year per employee). Multiply that by millions of workers, and you have a massive drag on productivity.\n“AI alone will not immediately elevate the country to the very top of the global production league,” Linstrom writes. “It will, however, offer part of a dependable future solution– perhaps in the most unexpected and pioneering ways.”\nBy partnering with a company like IPsoft, IT organizations are able to employ a reliable, always-on, scalable digital colleague who can solve basic and, in some cases, more extreme IT issues without constant input from human workers.\nTo learn more about how AI can help improve productivity in the UK, and how it can solve IT issues, check out TechNative today.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ai-help-united-kingdom-boost-productivity/", "Role": ""},

What will it take to drive similar adoption at the enterprise level? In an op-ed for the Forbes Technology Council, IPsoft President and CEO Chetan Dube examines what’s truly lacking in today’s consumer-based voice-enabled products. \n\n\n\n\n\nSeventy-two percent of American adults have used voice-enabled products and services, most often in their homes, according to a PwC survey. General enthusiasm for voice-enabled products hasn’t immediately transferred to the enterprise. A survey of IT decision-makers found that only 28% of businesses use voice as part of any workflows.\nIn an op-ed published by the Forbes Technology Council, IPsoft President and CEO Chetan Dube examines the reasons behind the disparity. In particular, he points to a dearth of highly intelligent voice-enabled products capable of handling the complex workflows associated with business processes.\n“Voice’s growing ubiquity is a precursor to the next wave of market commoditization within just the next few years,” Dube writes. “This commoditization will force vendors to focus not simply on voice but the intelligence behind it, particularly for enterprise customers who will depend on these services to achieve their business goals, including revenue growth, better customer experiences and increased customer satisfaction.”\nWhat exactly will these intelligent products look like? Dube asserts the enterprise market for voice-enabled products won’t accelerate until more products are able to go beyond simple question-and-answer responses, and deliver experiences similar to human employees.\n“Intelligence will ultimately separate truly cognitive, voice-enabled AI from other products in the market that simply respond in a static question-and-answer manner,” he writes. “In other words, the unique intelligence of an AI-powered voice — not the mere fact that devices or services have one — will be key to creating vendor differentiation and spark voice’s growth at the enterprise level.”\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Check out this op-ed for Sifted, The Financial Times’s new-media platform for European innovators and entrepreneurs, by IPsoft’s Digital Fellow to the CEO Mark Minevich. In the piece, he examines the primary areas toward which the EU should focus its efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can European nations learn from Japan as they develop a vision for new technologies? In an op-ed for Sifted, The Financial Times’s new-media platform for European innovators and entrepreneurs, IPsoft’s Digital Fellow to the CEO Mark Minevich examines how the European Union should focus its efforts, including those around Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nIn his piece, Minevich directs European companies and municipalities to focus on technological innovation in four major industries: Healthcare, Mobility, Infrastructure and FinTech. While researching and investing in these industries, Minevich suggests organizations should invest “with an eye toward humans as the primary focus, both in terms of users and the workforce maintaining the technology.”\nWhile a European roadmap for future technology development exists, the European Commission’s effort remains in draft state, with a deadline of March 2019 for final release. Until (and after) that report is published, it’s critical that additional conversations around investment and ethical use materialize within the European community, Minevich asserts in the op-ed. “As of today, the European Commission has pledged €1.5bn, an amount far less than what it will take to truly reimagine society,” he states.\nMinevich’s op-ed urges the EU to use Society 5.0 — Japan’s technological innovation vision to embed technology into every aspect of public life — as a template for European investment and strategy. By aligning municipalities with industry, Japan seeks to boost innovation in Infrastructure, FinTech, Healthcare, Logistics and AI. The Japanese project anticipates a global investment of €77bn in robotics by 2025, a far cry from the EU’s anticipated €1.5bn allocation.\nFor more on what the EU should seek to accomplish with technology investment and development, read Minevich’s op-ed in its entirety.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsoft-on-the-future-of-technology-innovation-in-europe/", "Role": ""},
{"Title": "IPsoft Introduces 1RPA, the World’s First RPA Solution Powered by Conversational AI", "Date": "January 29, 2019 • 3 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\n1RPA’s cognitive user interface, dynamic scalability, and ability to read and understand make it the easiest to use, most cost-effective and most intelligent RPA solution in the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, January 29, 2018 — IPsoft, the global leader in Enterprise AI, today announced the general availability of 1Desk’s™ 1RPA, the world’s first Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution powered by conversational AI. With 1RPA, businesses can easily create automations at scale, and at a much lower cost than traditional RPA tools.\nRPA enables software bots to mimic human interaction with a user interface. According to Forrester Research, the RPA market will reach $2.9 billion by 2021 as cognitive AI features are added to RPA offerings. Traditional RPA tools are difficult to implement, they age out quickly, and the cost of adoption lessens the overall financial benefit. As a result, only 11% of companies have adopted RPA widely across the enterprise, according to PwC. As 1RPA is both simple to use and cognitively enabled, IPsoft can eliminate these issues.\n“RPA is an important automation technology; however, according to HfS Research, 60% of the C-Suite leaders in the Global 2000 are not satisfied with the outcomes. This is primarily because of the manual overhead in configuring and maintaining the RPA solutions,” said Chetan Dube, CEO of IPsoft. “RPA needs to be self-actualizing and sentient for it to deliver on the expected ROI promises. It should autoconfigure itself based on observing the behaviors of agents serving clients. The launch of 1RPA is that watershed moment in the evolution of robotic automation technology.”\nCreating RPA Through Innovative AI\nUnlike other RPA tools, IPsoft’s cognitive AI offers clients a simple way to build automations without any coding or data structuring. As users guide 1RPA’s digital colleague, Amelia, through each step of a business process, Amelia builds an automation for them. There’s no need to write new code or structure unstructured data. Amelia understands a specific task and creates a bot in minutes.\nBots created with 1RPA can read web pages, emails, programs or any unstructured text put in front of them — just as a human would. They organize data as the business process requires and deliver the correct placements for an automation. This happens on-the-fly with no need for users to limit automations to structured formats.\nThe method by which 1RPA assigns bots to tasks is also unique and more cost-effective than other RPA tools. With 1RPA’s dynamic scalability, IPsoft doesn’t charge additional fees to generate more throughput. 1RPA is available as a yearly, per-bot subscription with no fees for any additional components or concurrent-running processes. 1RPA is as scalable as the compute power a customer enables.\nIPsoft has also designed 1RPA to be as user friendly as possible. 1RPA is agentless; unlike traditional RPA tools, 1RPA doesn’t require software agents to be installed on PCs. Companies can choose their own operating system for deployment: Windows, Mac, Linux — 1RPA works on any OS. Additionally, if a business already works with a traditional RPA vendor, IPsoft will work with its clients to leverage and reuse existing designs to create faster and more efficient 1RPA bots.\nEvaluating 1RPA\nYou can download 1RPA on Amelia.com and try out a local, standalone version of our software. As soon as a client becomes available IPsoft will make it accessible to you. Access the 1RPA platform and view training videos at: amelia.com/hyperautomation.\nIf companies like what they see, they can deploy 1RPA directly into production, or on a trial basis for a pilot. Either way, users will be building bots that are completing processes in their actual technology environment. IPsoft’s 1RPA professionals can provide assistance as needed and discuss how deploying the product can lead to adoption of the overall 1Desk platform, which includes 1RPA.\nAbout 1Desk\n1Desk is the first end-to-end IT operations management solution with a conversational interface. Ideal for stand-alone IT operations, 1Desk connects a company’s front- and back-office technology to form a single ecosystem for business systems. Using 1Desk allows businesses to automate simple IT tasks, create automations for new IT resolutions, and monitor the health of IT operations from one comprehensive user interface.\nBeyond IT support and operations, 1Desk can deliver shared business services across a variety of functions including Human Resources and Finance. If an employee has forgotten her HR system password, she can simply type a message to Amelia asking for a reset. Or if an employee needs to check on the status of expense report, he can ask Amelia for an update via his mobile phone. These are processes that have traditionally required volleys of emails and phone calls, with messages left in inboxes or voice mailboxes, while pressing work goes undone. With 1Desk -- a combination of 1RPA, autonomics, cognitive AI and analytics — enterprises can get the most out of their business processes and the employees who use them.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

In the piece, which focused on the Future of Work, Amelia is described as a “white-collar” worker armed with sophistication, curiosity and more.\nThe author references our stellar work with Allstate, where Amelia helps insurance agents quickly find accurate information during calls with customers. The author also referenced Amelia’s proof-of-value — she helped Allstate reduce call duration from 4.6 to 4.2 minutes, a 9% decrease.\n“Amelia works at the online and phone-in help desks at the Swedish bank SEB. Blond and blue-eyed, she has a confident bearing softened by a slightly self-conscious smile. Amelia also works in London for the Borough of Enfield and in Zurich for UBS,” the author writes. “And did I mention that Amelia can memorize a 300-page manual in 30 seconds, speak 20 languages and handle thousands of calls simultaneously?”\nThe author delves into the pros and cons of automation and how it will impact service-sector jobs, as well as how data will be used to reimagine the way work is done.\n“Amelia is used by over 20 of the world’s leading banks, insurers, telecom providers, media companies and healthcare firms. Research had shown that customer satisfaction with phone-in helplines is directly tied to empathy shown by the agent handling the call, so Amelia’s maker added a psychological module to her algorithm,” he writes. “She is aware of the emotional state of the person with whom she is speaking, and she adapts her responses, facial expressions and gestures to better communicate. Amelia can’t handle everything. Sometimes she passes on information to her human colleagues so they can take over. But Amelia is curious. The software hangs on the line listening to the humans—and the resolution of a problem. She then adds these new tricks to her knowledge-management system. Once her learnings are approved by her human supervisor, she can answer similar queries herself in the future.”\nAs in this article, we’ve examined in several blog posts how AI will change how people work, allowing them to have access to more data in less time, and how it will help them focus on more interesting tasks rather than the same repetitive processes. We’ve also written extensively about the role AI will play in improving employee experiences and productivity.

In an article issued this month, McKinsey breaks down the key considerations for choosing a solution, and why IPsoft is among the industry leaders in the intelligent process automation space.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the right IT automation platform can be a daunting task. To help companies find the best solution for their specific needs, McKinsey this month published an insightful primer on the different options available. The firm estimates companies are already automating 50% to 70% of IT tasks and the companies that lag “may soon find themselves in catch-up mode and at an increasing (and perhaps enduring) competitive disadvantage.”\nIPsoft is mentioned prominently throughout the article as a company that can help organizations with “larger automation ambitions, such as reengineering IT self-management or proactive machine-learning-enabled identification of the root causes of incidents,” among other areas.\nThe piece references our entire product suite — 1Desk, IPcenter and Amelia — with specific attention paid to 1Desk’s architecture and how the platform’s virtual engineers respond to common IT problems. “IPsoft, for example, has a vision for autonomous computing that includes a self-healing IT environment capable of resolving incidents, performing planned activities, and learning new capabilities over time,” the author writes.\n“Taking the time to assess the IT organization’s specific needs can enable CIOs to make an informed platform decision that is more likely to deliver early benefits and pave the way for a fruitful automation journey in the years ahead,” according to the post.\nWe couldn’t agree more.

Read this article to learn more about why tools like Amelia are usurping scripted chatbot technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve spent a lot of time explaining the reasons why our intelligent virtual agent, Amelia, is more valuable than the chatbots that are used by some companies for service-related tasks. Thankfully, Information Age has done an excellent job communicating this message for us. In an article entitled \"The Digital Colleague is Here…Say Hello to Your New Co-Worker,” the author makes the case that agents such as Amelia offer a “personalized service that is not presumptive, and responds to the needs of the client.”\nIn the piece, Johan Toll, Executive Director of Transformations at IPsoft, provides commentary on the technical differences and extreme limitations of chatbots compared to more intelligent systems. “I can read an HR policy but it’s not until I understood it and transform it into knowledge that I can actually make use of it and provide something which helps a client,” Toll says. “And chatbots are usually a question-answering technology, but with a digital colleague you can actually do complex business processes and change between them: go back and forth and still figure out everything that came into the conversation.”\nThe author makes another excellent point: Humans are unpredictable and prone to changing their minds, making mistakes, and speaking in disjointed words and phrases. “It’s very important for the technology that forms the foundation of the digital colleague to be able to have a human-like conversation and be able to respond to the nuances of the imperfect human,” he writes.\nSomeone with little-to-no familiarity with chatbots or digital colleagues could be forgiven if they still had lingering questions about the differences between the two technologies. The author sums it up best: “[A] really capable chatbot solution or virtual assistant that really understands the concept of self-awareness and has the ability to empathise, understand the client, be able to understand the context and really behave in a human-like manner” should be classified as a digital colleague.\nTo learn more, be sure to check out Toll’s second interview with Information Age, in which he discusses the benefits of natural language processing for digital processes.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/information-age-the-difference-between-chatbots-and-digital-colleagues-like-amelia/", "Role": ""},

CMO Australia recently interviewed IPsoft’s Chief Commercial Officer Jonathan Crane about how AmeliaTM is set apart from the competition, how she is reinventing business operations today and how she will develop into the future.\nThe profile emphasizes Amelia’s various implementations as an external customer-facing Virtual Customer Agent. For the uninitiated, Amelia is sometimes thrown into the same bucket as low-level chatbots, which have been around for decades. However, Amelia offers far much more value.\nAmelia is trained in conversational intelligence, problem solving and context. She can discern what you’re asking then converse with you on how to help.\nOne of the chief differentiators, according to Crane, is the versatility that Amelia offers compared to a mere chatbot, which usually follows rigid decision trees and only responds correctly to specific keywords or phrases. Crane says this is not useful in the majority of use cases.\n“Say I have a customer who wants car insurance: There’s no way to script a chatbot to have a full conversation about car insurance; you’d be surprised at how many ways people ask about car insurance,” Crane explains. “Amelia is trained in conversational intelligence, problem solving and context. She can discern what you’re asking then converse with you on how to help.” (You can read more about how Amelia’s brain works here.)\nAmelia has proven her ability to build new business value within multiple industries. When asked where Amelia is making the biggest splash, Crane mentions two that have been consistently forward-thinking with AI: “Financial services and insurance were first, and the reason is simple: They have large inbound centres facing repetitive questions that lend themselves to the kinds of things we can do with AI. For example, we have one company who was trying to handle 1.2 billion calls per year. They could respond by using human capital, yet those calls typically aren’t revenue creating. They need an appropriate solution instead of that volume of people.”\nAs for the future implementations he’s excited about, Crane provides insights on how Amelia can be particularly useful for retail outlets to enhance their brick-and-mortar experiences. “With AI, we can guide people, help them make decisions and have informed personnel available. If staff don’t know the products, they could wear an Apple Watch and ask Amelia. Or the retailer could have a kiosk set up in-store,” he says.\nLearn more about Amelia and how she can reinvent business.

Read this post to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs IPsoft’s “The Real Women Behind Amelia\" series can attest, we place tremendous value in highlighting our extraordinary colleagues. As part of Women’s History Month, Forbes Contributor Rajinder Tumber profiled Tracey Robinson, one of the truly elite members of the IPsoft team.\nAs the Director of Cognitive Implementation, Tracey is responsible for ensuring companies generate the most business value from our industry-leading technologies. In the Q&A session with Rajinder, Tracey discusses her role at IPsoft and the path that led her to a career in Artificial Intelligence.\n“Throughout my career in various industries, AI has always fascinated me. I’d say it began during my work as a criminal intelligence analyst in the police force; I was always looking for ways to leverage AI to help investigate crimes and predict crime trends without bias,” Tracey told Rajinder. “Following that, during my time in insurance and healthcare I was interested in learning how we could leverage AI to improve the quality of customer and patient experiences.”\nThe conversation also touches on what it’s like for Tracey to be successful professional in a field that tends to attract more male employees. On this subject, Tracey offers the following advice to any women who are looking to join the AI industry:\n“One of the best pieces of advice I received at 19 years of age as a probationary constable in the police. My first ever sergeant told me if you want to be good at anything you must learn to ‘adapt and overcome.’ While this was targeted to policing at the time, his advice was specific to being resilient to rapid and constant change. Drawing this back to AI (and life in general), the technology is evolving at a rapid pace, the competition in the market is fierce and the impact it will have on the future of work, healthcare and society at whole will be enormous. Every day is a new learning experience, especially when you’re operating on the edge of emerging technology and applying it in the field. So my advice is to ‘adapt and overcome.’”\nIf you’re inspired by Tracey’s words, and you’re interested in pursuing a career in the AI field, check out our careers page.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsoft-cognitive-director-profiled-for-womens-history-month/", "Role": ""},

Now they’re viewed as essential leaders who can enable and transform business operations through innovative technology. Artificial Intelligence (AI), by delivering new types of digital business processes, is poised to expand CIOs remit even further.\nThis is the focus of the latest op-ed from IPsoft CEO Chetan Dube.

Additionally, as IT support issues are automated by on-demand digital labor, CIOs will be able to measure improved productivity, customer and employee satisfaction, and even increased time-to-market for new products and services.

IPsoft’s CEO Chetan Dube details the reasons why AI will benefit future workforces rather than eliminate them. Read his op-ed on TLNT.com to learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n“AI is not a replacement for people, but for tasks.”\nThis is the central theme of IPsoft Founder and CEO Chetan Dube’s most recent op-ed for TLNT.com. As businesses automate routine tasks and processes, concerned parties rightfully wonder what will become of the employees previously responsible for performing these jobs. IPsoft’s position has always been clear: We believe automation will serve as a mechanism for accelerating industry, allowing workers to serve more creative and high value roles.\n“As a growth business with the potential to spread across industries, AI actually stands to open up more business opportunities than close them, catalyzing yet another impending revolution to cascade across business and culture,” Chetan writes. “Yes, automating certain business operations will reduce or eliminate the need for many rote tasks — just as technological innovations before it. But where autonomic and cognitive systems stand to shine, more than any predecessors, is in their ability to create – new ideas, new solutions, new streams of revenue, new industries entirely —  and with it, new roles for workers to direct and harness these new creations.”\nTo reinforce his point, Chetan references the personal computer revolution of the 1980s and 1990s. Although PCs made math instantaneous, the world still relies on CPAs for accounting tasks, and the world has an equal if not greater need for math teachers at every stage of education.\n“As a tool, software has opened up creativity to the masses, but has not eliminated the need for talented artists with a penchant for design and creative flair,” Chetan declares.\nTo read more about why the future of AI is not a dystopia, be sure to read Chetan’s op-ed on TLNT.com.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsofts-ceo-examines-ais-impact-on-future-employment/", "Role": ""},

Chief among these topics were business opportunities, industry regulation, workforce adjustments, and the ongoing improvement and evolution of AI.\nAn excellent analysis of the overarching DWS themes can be found in Compelo's recent coverage, which was based on discussions with IPsoft CEO Chetan Dube and other company leaders at a pre-DWS media event. “AI has the power to free humans from the ‘shackles of the ordinary’ as the debate rages on about the increasing influence of the technology in the workplace,” author Dan Robinson writes, highlighting one of the key topics Chetan addressed during DWS.\nIn addition to Chetan, the author offers insight from Tracey Robinson, IPsoft’s Director of Cognitive Implementation, who addressed the concept of a hybrid workforce.\n“Humans will be able to transition from those repetitive tasks into areas where they can use human intelligence and robots won’t be able to,” Tracey said. “So we see ourselves being able to pull humans out of jobs where they don’t spend the best of their time and use digital colleagues instead so people are working on the best tasks for them.”\nIPsoft senior advisor Anders Borg, who previously served as the Swedish Minister of Finance, also spoke during the pre-event media gathering. Anders spoke of the need for organizations to quickly adjust to the new paradigms created by advanced technologies.\n“Organisations will need to be faster than normal in their response if they are to survive,” the author writes, summarizing a key focus of Anders’ commentary. “The upcoming rollout of 5G over the next 12 to 18 months will pose particular challenges, he believes, as increased connectivity will lead to an exponential rise in the amount of data created.”\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/compelo-highlights-key-topics-addressed-at-dws-2019/", "Role": ""},

In fact, AI allows companies to work more effectively and efficiently so current staff can move on to more complex tasks and projects, creating even more value with their work.

Incorporating advanced AI and complex Natural Language Understanding, Amelia can be directed using everyday language to perform basic functions, and is capable of recognizing context switching, intent, users’ emotional state and more.\nTransforming the student experience\nAt EHL, Amelia is being used to improve the staff and student experience, as well as introduce students to the leading-edge technologies that are transforming and improving the hospitality industry.\nAt the school, Amelia is providing on-site IT support by managing guest Wi-Fi access and resetting passwords. With the change in laws that require organizations to know who is connecting to their Wi-Fi, the system required a text to be sent to the user to enable them to connect. This was problematic given that the school welcomes visitors from 145 countries, and not everyone was able to receive those messages and connect. Now Amelia manages the end-to-end process of verifying and providing all guests with access to Wi-Fi. Students and all EHL employees can also use Amelia to change their passwords, interacting with her through a kiosk.\nAmelia is also supporting the student admission process. Previously, EHL had a chat box on its website that enabled students to interact with admission officers. However, frequently there was no one available to provide an immediate response. Now Amelia is able to provide 24/7 support to applicants, directly responding to questions relating to extensive admission information or, when she is not able to answer questions, sending a message to the officers to notify them to reply.\nInnovative technology at the heart of the curriculum\nAmelia not only improves students’ experience at EHL, CIO Julia Aymonier believes the technology plays an important role in the curriculum.\n“In many cases, this is our students’ first interaction with a sophisticated digital assistant. Their experience of Amelia helps them understand the potential for and the important role that such leading-edge technologies will play in their future careers in the hospitality industry, which has become in itself a key part of the students’ curriculum. In turn, this makes EHL even more attractive to aspiring industry leaders, as our students know they will leave the school on the pulse of the best and latest customer experiences,” Aymonier commented.\n“While some people in the industry have understandable concerns about the role of Artificial Intelligence in replacing jobs, our use of Amelia has shown the massive potential to improve the user experience — whether that’s of our students today or their future customers. Digital assistants will never replace the human interactions that are fundamental to delivering the superior customer service that our students go on to provide at some of the most prestigious hotels, restaurants and global firms. However, they do present an immense opportunity to improve the customer experience of more mundane tasks, like booking taxis or ordering room service. And we’re helping open our students’ eyes to this potential,” she said.\nCognitive Centre of Excellence\nEHL has created a dedicated Centre of Excellence team focused on exploring Amelia’s capabilities, comprised of five permanent and two rotating team members. The team is already exploring other possible applications for Amelia across the new EHL campus that is under construction, including implementations to help improve wait times in the cafeteria.\nChetan Dube, CEO at IPsoft said: “EHL has been a pioneer in exploring ways that Amelia can transform the experience of its students and staff. We are delighted that Amelia has not only provided a valuable business impact for EHL, through its service desk innovations, but that she continues to inspire the next generation of hospitality leaders in how digital assistants can transform customer experience.”\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

This competition in the face of rapid evolution was the subject of a recent feature in IDG Connect by journalist Marc Ambasna-Jones titled “AI is starting to drive survival of the fastest” (registration required) where he interviews IPsoft CEO Chetan Dube.\nThe author interviewed Chetan from our Amelia City experience lab in our NYC headquarters to discuss AI’s impact on the modern enterprise, as well as the role of IPsoft’s suite of intelligent solutions in this new era. \"There is a blurring of the lines between human cognitive capabilities and what machine cognitive capabilities are,” Chetan says, “and we are really starting to answer that ever-allusive Turing question: ‘Can machines think?’\"\nChetan goes on to explain that these transformative technologies are “breaking down the old silos and allowing some unique business models to emerge.\" This rapid change brought about by AI is the Darwinist crux of the article: Just as the emergence of disruptive forces in the natural world would cause many species to fall by the wayside, the same could be said for businesses as well. The companies that do not, at the very least, take these disruptions seriously risk falling behind, if not falling into irrelevance altogether.\nRead more of Chetan’s comments in the full article.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/idg-discusses-digital-darwinism-with-ipsoft-ceo-chetan-dube/", "Role": ""},

The study also found that 52% of jobs will be done by algorithmic agents by 2025.\nThis was the focus of a recent interview of IPsoft CEO Chetan Dube on Fox Business Network. Speaking on the network’s program, Countdown to the Closing Bell, Chetan discussed the massive implications automation will have on the future of labor, not only in manufacturing and service industries, but across all sectors and roles.\n“The vast consensus is that algorithms will do the majority of work done by humans today,” Chetan said. “This is going to be agnostic to sectors. This is a revolution that is going to hit everyone.”\nChetan spoke with the host about IPsoft’s intelligent virtual agent Amelia and the many ways she will help businesses move human labor off of rote programmable tasks, and onto more complex and valuable roles.\nChetan referenced IPsoft’s work with Telefónica as an ideal example of how human and digital workforces will be reorganized in order to maximize the potential for both. By implementing Amelia, digital labor will handle roughly 250,000 calls per day for Telefónica, or more than 6 million calls per month, entirely replacing the company’s IVR-based customer service system. During her interactions, Amelia recognized customer intent correctly on 83% of calls. She helped reduce the overall number of calls handled from 45 million in 2016 to 38 million in 2018. Internal call transfers decreased from 25% to 22% during that time period, and she was able to respond to initial queries in only three seconds.\n“Today, if you want to hire somebody you go to a CareerBuilder, a Monster or LinkedIn. Within the next 24 months or less, you will go to a store where you will hire a digital worker,” said Chetan. “This decade onward is [about] replacing labor with digital labor. You’re going to go to the store and hire your claims processing agent, insurance agent, bank teller, database administrator, your IT service desk expert, and Amelia is emblematic of that shift.”\nCompanies that find innovative ways to shift displaced human workers into more valuable roles will ultimately yield the most value from the digital workforce revolution.

That's the IQ of less than a six-year-old,” Chetan explained. “The challenge that most CEOs and CIOs face today is how are they going to deliver good customer experience and good customer service from a five-year-old's IQ? That is a challenge and that's where our motivation has been — to deliver a solution and an agent that it of comparable intellect to human agents.”\nChetan detailed how IPsoft is meeting this and other challenges with our industry-leading cognitive agent Amelia, and how she combines advanced functionality with scaled automation for real business benefit. While he commented that true AI is “very rare,” he said that it “has come of age. It can deliver not just the equivalent – but in some cases [exceed] – the human experience because of its ability to assimilate knowledge and mimic human intelligence.” He also pointed out that Telefonica, the largest telco in Latin America, has used Amelia to handle over 2.2 million calls last month itself with an intent recognition success of 87.2% — and serving more than 610 sessions concurrently. Now that is true digital revolution.”\nThe conversation also touched on technological breakthroughs that will transform not just business, but the world at large in relatively short order. “It's not a discussion if true Artificial Intelligence will start to rival human intellect. The only thing that is of discussion nowadays is when,” Chetan said. “Is it going to be in, as you mentioned, the Kurzweil, the singularity [predicted to take place] in 2030-35?

This new paradigm may allow employees to spend less time “on the clock” while subsequently maintaining — if not increasing — productivity.\n“If a four-day week is to be achieved, we need to find a solution that releases the burden from workers, whilst maintaining business efficiency and output,” he writes. “AI and automation are pivotal but there is an urgent need for businesses to redesign operational processes and rethink automation in order to provide a better employee experience.”\nBy automating routine, time-consuming tasks, Linstrom said workers will also be able to spend more of their time pursuing more fulfilling tasks, which creates new value for the business. “Automating tasks will significantly reduce employees’ workloads, helping us become more productive than ever before,” he explains. “Not only will this be a critical enabler for businesses to confidently reduce working hours without compromising efficiency, but it will also improve employee satisfaction as their office hours focus on more challenging, creative and emotionally resonant tasks.”\nSophisticated automation solutions open the door to new workday models for full-time in-house employees, but also gives companies the versatility to build workforces that consist of remote, part-time and temporary employees.

Workers will have a greater ability to independently locate answers to their questions, and resolutions to their issues, with little-to-no human intermediation.”\nTo read more of Martin’s piece in HR Technologist, click here.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/article-highlights-ais-impact-on-workers-and-company-structure/", "Role": ""},

One trend of particular promise is the rise of advanced cognitive solutions, which can automate complex, human-like engagements with users. These technologies, as explored in the post, are having an impact across multiple industries.\n“Insurance firms and banks are already leveraging customer-facing AI solutions to great effect today,” Linstrom said. “Many of them are in fact seeing increased customer satisfaction rates despite removing the human-to-human contact element. For example, since implementing IPsoft’s AI solution, Amelia, SEB, a leading Nordic bank, has been able to avoid 544 hours of escalations to customer support with an average handle time of six minutes. What’s more, Amelia has reached a 90% accuracy rate in immediate intent recognition which has meant a faster service delivery to customers and soaring customer satisfaction.” (You can read more about SEB’s implementation here.)\nOf course, AI does more than optimize processes; it can also have a profound impact on employees by freeing them from rote processes so they can concentrate on building business value through their uniquely human qualities such as creativity, empathy and problem solving. Many enterprises are already building this hybrid workforce which, as Linstrom puts it, is what happens “with human and digital colleagues working together to augment and improve our experience of work – [it] will be key to the future of work. Interacting through a cognitive human-like interface, employees could work directly with virtual assistants to automate the low-value work.”\nYou can read the full article here.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsofts-martin-linstrom-featured-in-silicon-uk-article-about-the-business-of-bots/", "Role": ""},

In the post titled “Can Conversational AI Solve the Obesity Crisis?”, Dr. Grasso lays the groundwork for how AI can be deployed to assist healthcare professionals and their patients with managing this condition.\n“Obesity is a preventable disease of clinical and public health importance. Responsible for more than 30,000 deaths each year in the UK, it contributes to serious conditions including Type 2 Diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, including breast, prostate and colon,” Dr. Grasso writes.\nDr. Grasso says AI can be leveraged for more frequent communication via conversational AI, as well as personalized health plans created by cognitive systems.\n“We all know that change happens when people are committed: but it’s still hard to make big life changes without regular and appropriate support,” Dr. Grasso explains. “Doctors and nurses just don’t have the capacity to deliver the frequent touchpoints needed to nudge people towards healthier behaviours. But by using conversational AI, we can help keep people engaged in their weight loss programme, share helpful tips to help them achieve their goals, and provide doctors with more information so they can further personalise health plans to empower individuals’ success.”\nFor more of Dr. Grasso’s thoughts on AI and obesity, be sure to read his op-ed in its entirety.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsofts-healthcare-lead-ai-can-help-fight-obesity/", "Role": ""},

Read this TechTarget post to read more about the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone who has ever wondered how AI makes decisions and improves upon them, a recent TechTarget post offers fantastic insight. The piece examines the difference between AI interpretability and explainability, and how people without scientific backgrounds can begin to understand how AI works.\nThe author draws a distinction between interpretability and explainability in how AI problems are presented to users within the context of a user experience: “AI interpretability is applied to the process of examining rules-based algorithms, while explainability is applied to the process of examining black box deep learning algorithms.”\nChris Butler, Chief Product Architect at IPsoft, is a proponent of explainability when describing interactions with experts, but prefers interpretability for describing interactions with other users. \"Explainability is a measure of how much an expert who understands all parts of a system would make decisions about that system,\" Butler told TechTarget.\nAs TechTarget explains: “The goal of explainability is an understanding so deep that the expert can build, maintain and even debug it, as well as use it. Interpretability, on the other hand, gauges how well any user — especially a non-expert — would understand why and what the system is doing either overall or for a particular case.”\n\"Humans can't possibly know everything about the way an organization works, and they don't have to with interpretability,\" Butler said.\nTo learn more about what experts have to say on this subject, be sure to read the TechTarget article.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsoft-exec-featured-in-techtarget-post-on-how-ai-makes-decisions/", "Role": ""},

Amelia’s new groundbreaking appearance, combined with her years of experience working for some of the world’s leading companies, allows for even more true-to-life communication and collaboration between humans and machines.\n\n\n\n\n\nIPsoft unveils new avatar for Amelia®, its market-leading Digital Employee™, to deliver the most human-like user experiences in the industry, building on Amelia´s advanced AI and natural language capabilities \nNEW YORK, January 21, 2020 – IPsoft, the largest independent leader in enterprise AI, today unveiled the new avatar of its market-leading Digital Employee, Amelia, who provides the most human-like digital experiences in the industry. Amelia’s new groundbreaking appearance, combined with her years of experience working for some of the world’s leading companies, allows for even more true-to-life communication and collaboration between humans and machines, elevating user experiences to new levels and empowering the hybrid workforce.\nThis new version of Amelia brings together her sophisticated cognitive capabilities — built to mirror the functions of the human brain — with the latest advancements in avatar technology. The avatar is designed to deliver the visual elements of human interaction — conversation, expression, emotion and understanding — to everyday user experiences, driving deeper customer connections and greater business value.\n“We have spent the last 20 years developing the most human-like digital being. Understanding the important role that visual cues play in human interaction, we are delighted to launch Amelia’s new avatar that will enable companies to digitally connect with their customers like never before,” said Chetan Dube, founder and CEO of IPsoft. “Amelia’s new look also far better reflects her superior cognitive abilities as the most advanced Digital Employee on the market.”\nAmelia has repeatedly been identified as industry-leading by independent analyst firms, including Forrester, Everest Group and Ovum. Unlike chatbots and more limited virtual assistants that react to keyword-driven instructions and follow static decision trees, Amelia's cognitive brain allows users to have natural, human-like conversations to execute tasks or resolve queries.\nUtilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), Amelia is able to understand natural language, follow context switching, and independently execute complex tasks to resolve user requests. In addition, her state-of-the-art affective computing and sentiment analysis enable her to recognize and adapt her responses based on the mood of the user and the context of the situation.\nAmelia’s deep learning capabilities also allow her to continuously learn from human interactions and create even more engaging experiences over time. Her ability to observe, learn, understand and improve her skills permits her to surpass standard digital assistants, elevating her into the world’s most human-like Digital Employee.\nBy deploying Amelia’s new avatar, enterprises will now be able to engage with users using human-like digital representatives, powered by sophisticated conversational AI technology. Internally, Amelia-powered solutions can translate into higher employee satisfaction and engagement leading to a more productive workforce. Among external customers, Amelia’s avatar can build stronger brand loyalty, encourage repeat business, and drive new sources of revenue.\nDube said: “By 2025, I believe that you could pass a colleague in the hall at work and not know if it’s a man or machine. Amelia’s new lifelike avatar takes us one step nearer to closing that gap between physical and digital colleagues to create a truly hybrid workforce.”\nIn addition to featuring a more human-like avatar, Amelia will soon be extended with more accessible design tools to enable non-technical workers to train and deploy Amelia in less than 30 minutes in different use cases across a business. This will enable workers with little or no technical expertise to collaborate with and manage Amelia, so deployment time is accelerated, driving quicker time-to-value.\nThe reach of Amelia will significantly expand with IPsoft’s forthcoming launch of a marketplace for Digital Employees. This marketplace will provide a more seamless and modern approach to deploying AI, one that more closely resembles person-to-person hiring and onboarding processes compared to traditional AI implementations. A webinar on the new marketplace, featuring CEO Chetan Dube and Vice President of Emerging Technologies Ergun Ekici, will be held Wednesday, Feb. 5th at 11 am ET.

Amelia´s cognitive brain includes state-of-the-art affective computing and sentiment analysis to enable her to model and appropriately respond to a user's emotion, mood and personality. Amelia’s deep learning capabilities enable her to continuously learn from human interactions and create even more engaging experiences.\nWith Amelia’s interpersonal and communication skills, human workers with little or no technical expertise can collaborate with Amelia as easily as they do with each other. Amelia’s interactions far surpass the experience delivered by back-end automation bots (RPA) that can only understand structured data or APIs as input, not unscripted requests given by users in natural language. Unlike chatbots that react solely to keyword-driven instructions and follow limited, static decision trees, Amelia uses Natural Language Processing to easily recognize intent and decipher unstructured dialogue. With advanced context switching and awareness, Amelia can switch between subjects with ease without losing any inputted information, helping her resolve complex user requests faster.\nDube added: “While some enterprises are downloading bots in an attempt to build a hybrid workforce, DigitalWorkforce.ai is the only marketplace with digital replicas of human job roles, utilizing Digital Employees with both front- and back-end proficiency. People continuously learn and improve at their jobs by collaborating and interacting with customers, colleagues and competitors — the same applies to AI. We are already seeing the substantial impact that automation and cognitive AI can have on an organization’s productivity and efficiency.”\nBuilding on decades of innovation in automation and AI, IPsoft continues to fundamentally expand what automation and cognitive technologies can accomplish and demonstrate its ongoing leadership in enterprise AI. With DigitalWorkforce.ai, the market moves closer to IPsoft’s vision of a symbiotic digital-human workforce, giving companies the ability to fully harness the potential ROI in AI. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2018, 133 million new roles may emerge that will be adapted to the new division of labor between humans, machines and algorithms.\nExperience the World’s First Digital IT Service Desk Engineer\nBusinesses can now hire a Digital Employee on DigitalWorkforce.ai for a free 30-day trial. DigitalWorkforce.ai will be available in English at launch; French, Spanish and German language skills will be forthcoming as part of Amelia’s multilingual capabilities.\nA webinar introducing the marketplace, including a live demo, will be held by IPsoft CEO Chetan Dube and VP for Emerging Technologies Ergun Ekici on Wednesday, Feb. 5th at 11 am ET.

The marketplace will soon offer digital employees for administration and HR as well as other industry-specific roles.”\nThe article highlights critical differences between Amelia, with her prowess in conversational AI, and other AI-related technologies: “Unlike solutions underpinned solely by chatbots or robotic process automation (RPA), Amelia's cognitive intelligence allows her to interact naturally with humans and continuously learn from every interaction, all while integrating and communicating with back-end systems.”\nIPsoft CEO Chetan Dube, a longtime advocate of the emerging digital-human hybrid workforce, tells Forbes that Digital Employees can help democratize AI, putting innovation into the hands of companies that previously might have considered such technology out of reach.\n“SMBs are increasingly investing in more sophisticated and intelligent solutions. Digital customer service agents, for example, leverage artificial intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and neural network algorithms to deliver more human-like experience that is more satisfying to users and to execute tasks independently, so they can resolve customer queries. This is truly helping small firms punch above their weight for customer experience,” Chetan says.\nRead the entire piece here.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/forbes-highlights-amelia-in-article-on-the-future-of-work/", "Role": ""},

While engaged in conversation, Amelia will assess a user based on current symptoms and potential risk factors as recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The World Health Organization (WHO).\nAs more American cities restrict movement, the new solution aims to provide the general public, as well as vulnerable populations, with accurate, on-demand information about COVID-19. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions constitute nearly 20 percent of the US population and are most at-risk for developing serious complications from COVID-19.\nThis version of Amelia also aims to alleviate pressure on hospitals, clinics, physicians’ offices and medical care centers that are fielding non-urgent questions related to COVID-19. As a cognitive agent capable of interacting naturally with humans, Amelia can relieve health institutions so that they are able to focus their efforts on populations with the greatest need.\n“Levels of anxiety are growing across the country, and we think everyone can use a little peace of mind. We believe that Amelia can do that by bringing verifiable information regarding risk and response into people’s homes,” said Dr. S. Vincent Grasso (DO, MSIS, MBA), Global Practice Leader for Healthcare & Life Sciences at IPsoft. “By helping people to access information, we hope to reduce anxiety during this COVID-19 pandemic. Amelia provides a safe experience for consumers to access screening, without the need to travel to a facility and risk exposure.”\nBest known as an enterprise solution, Amelia has been used by brands around the world to distill data and information to millions of customers and employees. To screen for COVID-19, Amelia will continuously be updated based on guidelines from the CDC and WHO.\nAmelia is currently available for free unlimited use to help screen for COVID-19 in English at +1 (917) 540-9885 by phone, and can be reached at the following link on Firefox, Chrome, and mobile browsers: https://amelia.ai/covid-19/.\nAdditional information:\n\nAmelia does not provide medical advice and is not intended to treat or diagnose.

Accessible via Sharecare’s website and smartphone app, the screener is also available for free to any U.S. organization to put on their website in an effort to empower people to reduce the spread of COVID-19 while easing the strain on healthcare providers.\nOne of Sharecare’s strategic partners in the Blue Zones Project® – the proven community well- being improvement initiative impacting 3.5 million people across 51 communities in North America by optimizing the environments where people spend their time – Pisgah Health Foundation is the first institution to extend this resource to the communities it serves. Driven by its mission to purposefully, creatively and collaboratively enhance health and well-being across western North Carolina, Pisgah Health Foundation’s reach spans more than 300 local non-profit organizations, provider groups and public health departments.\n“Our aim at the Pisgah Health Foundation is to improve the overall well-being of the communities we serve through innovation and partnerships. With the support of Sharecare and the Blue Zones Project, we are rapidly responding to the needs of our community during this uncertain time by deploying resources and lifesaving capabilities like Sharecare’s screener to our residents and strategic partners,” said Lex Green, president at Pisgah Health Foundation.\nWith the novel coronavirus pandemic forcing social distancing and shelter-in-place orders across the United States, Sharecare incorporated the latest guidance* on COVID-19 into AskMD, its award-winning symptom checker that was built from more than 20 years of military- funded research, led by medical informatics pioneer Dr. Larry Weed. The company partnered with NTT DATA to integrate the dynamic AskMD algorithm into an interactive conversational solution powered by IPsoft’s industry-leading cognitive AI, Amelia. By harnessing the power of Amelia’s true-to-life conversational abilities, the resulting COVID-19 screener from Sharecare allows people to get answers quickly and anonymously without having to wait, helping them understand the severity of their COVID-19 risk; and whether they need to go to the emergency room, consult a medical professional, or stay home and monitor symptoms.\n“Every day, healthcare providers receive a swell of inbound calls from people concerned about the health and well-being of their families, and they just don’t have the resources to field every concern at scale. Amelia is a screener capable of answering hundreds of thousands of calls each day, and she can evolve to help answer questions safely and with a high degree of accuracy,” said Dr. S. Vincent Grasso (DO, MSIS, MBA), global practice leader for Healthcare & Life Sciences at IPsoft. “Sharecare’s integration of Amelia and AskMD will give a concerned and anxious public the answers they need, and allow medical professionals to focus on tackling the global pandemic from the front lines.”\n“We are proud to be called upon by Sharecare to assist in bringing this capability to potentially millions of people across the country,” said Mary Edwards, President, Healthcare, NTT DATA Services. “There is no more important work for us right now than helping our clients and partners respond to the demands of COVID-19 and being a part of quickly bringing them innovations, like Amelia, that can make a difference in the fight against COVID-19.”\nAs an established, trusted source for health information, Sharecare continues to deliver relevant and timely information through its platform to help people on their health journeys, which are rapidly changing every day in the face of COVID-19.

Together they provide an integrated suite of best-in-class cognitive technology that resolves all workplace issues from tech and HR to legal and finance.\nSince the partnership began, the capabilities of InteliServe™ with Amelia®, IPsoft’s industry-leading Digital Employee™, have continued to improve and expand to support users across all channels. Amelia is now the first point of contact for InteliServe™, bringing a consistent experience and reaching all users regardless of work location (home, office, or on the run). This on-demand support model has been critical during the recent work environment shift users have faced during the current pandemic.\n“As companies implemented work-from-home policies amid the COVID-19 threat, we have seen a considerable uptick in our clients’ service desk call volume,” said Mickey Davis, Global Vice President, Digital Workplace Services, Unisys. “Since Amelia is now integrated with telephony, the volume of calls can be resolved more quickly, increasing user-experience and agent productivity.”\nAs we look to the future and a new normal, Unisys will begin using Amelia to provide internal support. She will interact with Field Service technicians to achieve lower resolution times and improve satisfaction through automation of tasks.\nAmelia is trained on the most common support requests, FAQs and more complex questions that InteliServe™ handles. She is capable of complex natural language understanding, context switching and intent recognition, which means that she understands, diagnoses and selects the optimal path to resolution for any individual user.\n“Our partnership delivers highly automated, streamlined and cost-effective IT support with conversational AI. Amelia brings a new level of ROI through AI. Unlike chatbots, IPsoft’s cognitive agent Amelia does more than just recognize keywords and user questions. She observes, learns, understands and grows her skills over time,” said Scott Kohn, IPsoft’s Chief Channel Officer.\nIn the event that Amelia is not yet trained to complete a user’s support request, Amelia transfers the issue to the appropriate human colleague for completion. Amelia's continuous learning capabilities allow her to observe and learn from the interaction, leading to more rapid resolutions in subsequent support requests.\nAmelia is consistently recognized by third-party analyst firms as a market-leading solution. In a recent New Wave report, Forrester said IPsoft “leads the pack with robust IT operations chatbot features.” The research reviewed “the eight most significant providers in the category” and scored vendors against 10 criteria, including chatbot readiness, automation, architecture and integrations, and deployment and security. According to Forrester, IPsoft received a “differentiated” rating in all 10 categories — the highest rating possible — and IPsoft was the only vendor to achieve that rating in every category.\nAbout Unisys\nUnisys is a global information technology company that builds high-performance, security-centric solutions for the most demanding businesses and governments.

{"Title": "IPsoft Launches Amelia for Customer Care to Help Organizations Scale and Enhance Customer Service", "Date": "June 2, 2020 • 3 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nIPsoft announced the launch of Amelia for Customer Care, a cloud-based Digital Employee that can help companies accelerate their first-touch customer interactions and time to resolution (TTR) rates. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Digital Contact Center Employee, who handles 4.5 million calls/month at Telefónica, can now be cloud-sourced via DigitalWorkforce.ai to support more companies in delivering scaled and superior customer service\nNew York, June 2, 2020 - IPsoft, the largest independent leader in enterprise AI, today announced the launch of Amelia for Customer Care, a cloud-based Digital Employee that can help companies accelerate their first-touch customer interactions and time to resolution (TTR) rates. Amelia is capable of handling most common customer service tasks without human support, empowering customers to self-serve and resolve issues independently, so they can more quickly connect with human agents for more complex issues.\nAmelia for Customer Care is available on DigitalWorkforce.ai, the world’s first marketplace for Digital Employees that come with decades of experience in enterprise AI for specific roles and skills. The new Digital Contact Center Employee can be deployed in hours and days - not weeks and months – and is easily trainable on company customer service policies (orders, returns, etc.) for faster near-term ROI.\nHigh-volume contact centers are struggling with demand; companies with overburdened and ineffective phone-based IVR (interactive voice response) systems can hire Amelia for Customer Care to immediately improve customer experiences and relieve the pressure on their call center agents.\nTelefónica Peru introduced digital voice agents in its call centers with several objectives: to drive customer experience, to optimize costs, and to make use of all the valuable data customers provide during interactions with call centers.\n“We discovered that the main catalyst for our digital transformation would be to focus on customer-facing processes,” said Gonzalo Gomez Cid, Global Contact Center Director at Telefónica. “We wanted to be 24/7, anytime, anywhere, transparent and personalized. Our priority was to address the volume of handled calls, to capture customer impact and benefits, and to impact call center infrastructure and CRM systems. Today Amelia handles 250,000 calls per day, or more than 4.5 million calls per month, in one of the most demanding operations of Telefonica in Peru, entirely replacing the previous IVR-based customer service system. During her interactions, Amelia recognized customer intent correctly on 90% of calls.”\nUnlike solutions underpinned solely by chatbots or robotic process automation (RPA), Amelia’s cognitive intelligence allows her to interact naturally with humans and continuously learn from every interaction. Available 24/7 through voice and webchat, she integrates and communicates with a company’s back-end systems, as well as CRM and call center solutions such as Genesys, Salesforce, Service Now and Avaya to independently resolve a number of key tasks. Where requests fall beyond her skillset, she escalates and collaborates with human employees to solve issues and learn from the experience. For one European bank, Amelia handles customer care for more than 68 million global customers, and routes and resolves more than 100+ million calls per year; she consistently achieves 98% accuracy and now handles 32% of calls without human support.\nChetan Dube, CEO at IPsoft, commented: “Many companies are struggling to keep up with customer service demand. Undoubtedly many firms’ most immediate and acute challenge is handling the massive spikes in inquiries contact centers are handling due to the shift away from physical stores and branches in the current climate. However, a longer-standing concern has been around satisfying evolving expectations for more channels, more choices, increased flexibility and quicker resolutions. Digital Contact Center Employees will be critical in helping organizations triage customer calls at scale and resolve inquiries on the first touch, ensuring that calls are only routed to human agents when necessary. This will help improve the customer experience and TTR, with more simple requests capable of simple self-serve resolution and more complex issues getting through to human agents much faster.”\nAmelia®, IPsoft’s industry-leading cognitive AI agent that underpins the solution, has repeatedly been identified as market-leading technology by Everest Group, Forrester and Ovum. Thanks to her ability to switch contexts and interact conversationally in natural language, Amelia for Customer Care is as intuitive an experience as with a human agent. Relieving human employees of rote and repeatable tasks in turn enables them to focus on higher-value work, with Amelia having a demonstrable improvement on organizations’ customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores.\nCompanies can hire Amelia for Customer Care today on DigitalWorkforce.ai. for a variety of roles and skills, including:\n\nCustomer Portal\n\nPortal Access Manager\nPortal Troubleshooting (such as password resets)\n\n\n\n\nProduct/Service Orders \n\nProduct/Service Tutorials\nProduct/Service FAQs\nRefund Requests\n\n\n\n\nShipping Manager\n\nProduct/Service Issues\nProduct Insurance Claims\nProduct Returns and FAQs\n\n\n\n\nAppointment management (including scheduling, rescheduling and cancelling) \n\n\nStore Locator\n\n\nCompany FAQs\n\nBuilding on decades of innovation in automation and AI, IPsoft continues to fundamentally expand what automation and cognitive technologies can accomplish, and demonstrate its ongoing leadership in enterprise AI. As Amelia for Customer Care joins the ranks of Digital Employees at DigitalWorkforce.ai, the market moves closer to IPsoft’s vision of a symbiotic digital-human workforce, giving companies the ability to fully harness the potential ROI in AI.\nDownload the white paper.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

Prior to the pandemic, enterprises were already experiencing challenges maintaining customer service through seasonal variances of demand.\nChetan says enterprises that implemented AI-powered employees prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were better prepared for the ensuing shutdowns and work shortages, which came hand-in-hand with a dramatic spike in customer service volumes. The clear disparity between companies with and without conversational AI agents has left the lagging companies eager to catch-up. However, Chetan suggests that businesses should first identify their business problems, then research how AI may help resolve them with specific use cases.\nAI-powered employees also assist humans by taking on the stress of back-to-back challenging customer service calls, especially in contact centers dealing with major staffing issues. “As organizations look to reorder and reengage their workforces in the wake of a recovery, they should be looking to move people out of customer service support roles into jobs where they can use their unique human skills like critical thinking and creativity,” Chetan writes.\nTo read more of Chetan’s view, check out the full article at Forbes.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n                            Subscribe to Our Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\n\n", "Link": "https://amelia.ai/media-coverage/ipsoft-ceo-ai-is-critical-for-customer-service/", "Role": ""},

The series connects industry leaders, CEOs, senior executives and digital pioneers to discuss the major impact of the pandemic on global digitalization trends, and share concrete AI solutions that promise to reshape the way we live and work.\n“You’re starting to see that the old model of customer care has collapsed,” Chetan said, during the conversation. “When you have seven hours of wait time when calling one of the premier providers of travel in Europe, or two hours and twelve minutes with one of the largest banks here, you know that the old model of customer care has collapsed.”\nTo combat increasing service call volume initiated by stay-at-home orders, Chetan urged business leaders to build hybrid workforces composed of human workers and machines, one in which machines handle routine service calls while human workers handle more complex and unique customer interactions.\n“Man has to move up the value chain. Customer care is going to be done by machines and escalations will happen when humans come in,” he said. “Machines will take care of the mundane chores. What is the point of [human] creativity if on a given day less than 30% of your creative brain is engaged?”\n“The Digital Darwinistic Curve is being fast-forwarded right now and you’re starting to see a race up that curve,” Chetan added. “You’re finding a very fast transition into a digital mode of delivery.”\nDuring the conversation, Chetan spoke with the following executives:\n\nKeith Strier, VP of Worldwide AI Initiatives at NVIDIA\nSylvain Duranton, Managing Director and Senior Partner of BCG and Global Leader of BCG Gamma\nKris Fitzgerald, VP and CTO of NTT Data\nOsvald Bjelland, Chairman and CEO of Xynteo and Founder of TPT\nIgor Jablokov, CEO and Founder of Pryon\n\nIn addition to practical advice for businesses to survive the COVID-19 era, the speakers examined the future of AI and what needs to happen for advanced technologies to become mainstream solutions.\n“What if you really got close to mimicking human intellect? What would the world be like? What efficiencies could you drive? What would be the minimum viable incomes you could drive? And what kind of an impact could you have? Those questions have haunted me for the last two-and-a-half decades of research,” Chetan said.\nTo achieve this level of sophistication, Chetan said companies are working to build solutions that are more intelligent than automated voice systems and scripted chatbots.\n“The frontier of Artificial Intelligence is jumping from classification to comprehension. That’s the distinguishing factor of what we’ve been researching.

Recognizing the potential of AI and cognitive agents to improve customer relationships - both digitally and in bank branches - Bankia has chosen Amelia by IPsoft as the backbone of Bianka. Amelia is the result of more than 20 years of research and development and has been repeatedly recognized as the industry leader by independent analyst firms, including Everest Group, Forrester and Ovum.\nHer cutting-edge AI and Natural Language Understanding are capable of recognizing context switching, intent and customers’ emotional state. This enables Bianka to hold human-like conversations and execute tasks independently. Additionally, her advanced Machine Learning capabilities also mean that she constantly evolves over time to accumulate knowledge and improve the user experience.\nBankia customers will be served by Bianka in three areas:\n\nBankia Mobile Application — Once customers are logged into the mobile app, they can have a conversation with Bianka via chat or voice to request account information and complete transactions, such as money transfers through Bizum.\nCustomer Service Center — Bianka will serve clients through the customer service center, where they can now respond with open-ended questions when she asks \"How can I help you?\" When interacting with Bianka, customers will always arrive at a resolution: from user identification to the execution of tasks, such as blocking a lost credit card and requesting a new one. Bianka will be able to resolve many customer requests quickly because she has access to the bank’s backend systems, allowing her to solve queries immediately. When the requests are more complex or require human intervention, Bianka will transfer the call directly to a human employee. As a result, human employees can focus on resolving more complex tasks that bring greater value to the client.\nSupport for branch employees — Bianka also provides guidance to branch employees on more complex inquiries, such as requests about insurance. Employees are no longer required to speak with another customer service agent when they run into a problem. They can instead interact with Bianka by chat, who offers timely and detailed information about the process while the human agent is serving a customer. This not only provides more help for employees when they need it, but also allows them to improve the customer experience with more immediate responses.\n\nThese services were introduced for Bankia's 12,000 branch employees in December 2019 with a resoundingly positive response.\nElena Sanz, Director of Bankia Channel Architecture; Gema González, Director of Conversational Agents; and Eva Valle, Director of Control of Operations, said: “We are very satisfied with IPsoft’s support in Bianka’s launch, which is the bank's response to the needs of our digital customers. At Bankia, we have been integrating artificial intelligence into many of our processes for several years with the goal of improving our clients’ experience and making their lives easier. Technology offers us the opportunity to create great products and services and additionally allows our human employees to get personalized advice for their clients in our branches or through remote channels. All of this makes our banking proposal unbeatable.”\nChetan Dube, IPsoft CEO, said: “Bankia has shown that it is truly at the forefront of the banking digital revolution and that it is committed to improving the experience of both customers and employees by using cutting-edge technology. To date, as users, we’ve been continuously let down by so-called digital service improvements that are underpinned by frustrating and highly limited chat functions. However, by integrating true cognitive intelligence with the bank's backend services, Bankia has been able to offer a service that infinitely improves the experience of its customers and employees.”\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

{"Title": "Sterling National Bank Partners with Amelia — the Most Human AI™ — to Launch Cognitive Customer Service Agent ‘Skye’", "Date": "August 25, 2020 • 3 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nSkye will use Natural Language Understanding and Conversational AI to automate 3 million contact center inquiries per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York and Montebello, NY, August 25, 2020 — IPsoft, the global leader in enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Sterling National Bank, the wholly-owned operating bank subsidiary of Sterling Bancorp (NYSE: STL), today announced its partnership to deploy Amelia, the industry-leading Digital Employee™. Amelia is set to accelerate Sterling's digital transformation and provide enhanced customer service. With Amelia, Sterling National Bank aims to heighten customer engagement through its contact centers, reduce high-volume pressures on customer contact agents, and allow bankers to focus on providing unique and personalized service to customers across the business.\nAmelia will be used within Sterling National Bank’s Advanced Digital Technology Program, an enterprise strategic initiative to modernize Sterling’s infrastructure and deploy digital technologies that was launched in partnership with Deloitte in 2019. IPsoft’s advanced conversational AI replaces the bank’s traditional interactive voice response (IVR) system to deliver human-like communication and collaboration, allowing Sterling contact center agents to work with Amelia to create superior customer service experiences across multiple channels. The program provides a foundation for continued future growth through a highly scalable operating platform, advancing Sterling’s digital banking capabilities for commercial and consumer clients.\nSterling National Bank is deploying the technology under the name “Skye,” which will be a cognitive AI digital customer service colleague. After first authenticating clients, Skye can provide Sterling customers with information and updates on their account balances and recent transactions, as well as troubleshoot online banking issues, debit card claims and declined card transactions. Skye will be able to scale and resolve more than 50 percent of incoming calls into its contact centers. In addition, Skye will engage 100 percent of incoming customer calls and provide automated self-service for more than 3 million customer calls each year.\nAmelia’s advanced machine learning abilities will also allow Skye to constantly evolve and expand its intelligence capabilities with each user experience and interaction. This capability not only increases the accuracy of its responses and ability to manage more voice calls without human agent intervention, but it also informs the responses of a chat solution that Sterling plans to roll out in the near future.\n“Given Sterling National Bank’s growth trajectory, it was critical for us to significantly increase our bank’s digital footprint to ensure that both our customers and colleagues continue to have positive experiences and valuable interactions,” said Luis Massiani, Sterling National Bank President. “It was evident from the first time that we experienced Amelia’s capabilities that it would be key in supporting our digital expansion and customer service experience. We’re excited to be launching our very own ‘Skye’ as our Digital Employee that can provide human-like, superior banking experiences with scale and speed.”\n“During this challenging period where many bank branches remain closed all across the world, it has never been more important to have a scalable customer service solution to ensure that our limited ability to interact in the physical world doesn’t prevent customers from conveniently managing their banking services,” said Chetan Dube, CEO at IPsoft. “By taking advantage of the scalable and superior digital customer service capabilities of Amelia, Sterling National Bank is assuring its customers that it can support their banking needs no matter where they are — now and in the future.”\nPlease see www.deloitte.com/us/about for a detailed description of Deloitte's legal structure.\nAbout Sterling National Bank\nSterling National Bank specializes in the delivery of financial services and solutions for small to mid-size businesses and consumers within the communities we serve through a distinctive team-based delivery approach utilizing highly experienced, fully dedicated relationship managers.

{"Title": "New research: 71% of US executives will bring back furloughed workers  in the short-term, but AI investments made during the COVID-19 pandemic will continue shaping the US workforce", "Date": "August 27, 2020 • 4 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nIPsoft, the independent leader in enterprise AI, today announced new research, in partnership with Censuswide, examining the uptake of AI during the COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing impact on the American workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n88% of organizations added or scaled up AI technologies since the onset of the global pandemic\n\n\n82% intend to use AI and other emerging technologies to hedge against fully reopening their business to full capacity in 2020\n\n\n64% of respondents predict new technologies and people will replace more than 30% of their workforce by 2022\n\n\nNEW YORK, August 26, 2020—IPsoft, the independent leader in enterprise AI, today announced new research, in partnership with Censuswide, examining the uptake of AI during the COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing impact on the American workforce. The survey of 250 US CXOs, vice presidents and business owners revealed that while 71% of businesses [1] intend to safeguard jobs by bringing back furloughed workers, almost two thirds anticipated significant turnover within the next two years. Sixty-four percent predicted that their organizations will replace 31% or more of their workforces with new technologies or new people in order to better meet strategic goals by 2022.\nAI is supporting business continuity during the pandemic\nThe nationwide study of executives at medium and large organizations [2] found that 88% of businesses added or scaled AI within their organizations during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Appearing to prioritize immediate needs, these organizations invested in applications that could help answer customer calls (53%), analyze large data sets (57%), provide employees with IT services (53%), provide employees with HR services (49%), assess customers for eligibility or risk (49%), and perform contactless intake calls (47%). Forty percent also introduced AI to perform mid-senior level, white-collar tasks, indicating investment in sophisticated AI solutions that go beyond robotic process automation software (RPA) and the use of bots.\nAI has been so effective at bolstering operations during the pandemic that 82% of respondents said they intend to use AI and other emerging technologies to hedge against reopening to full capacity in 2020. The figure rises to 91% among respondents in the financial sector and 83% among those working in the IT and telecoms industry. The increase highlights the capability of sophisticated AI to fulfill job functions in low-touch industries, including white-collar work.\nPeople are a major factor in AI adoption\nBusiness continuity is a significant priority for organizations adopting or scaling AI technology during the pandemic. However, as many as 91% of executives said they also consider how the technology will impact their existing employees before they acquire or scale it [3].  Just under 3 in 5 (59%) respondents [4] claimed that AI experience is the most attractive trait to the hiring team for a CV. The majority of respondents reported looking at how AI supports a more flexible working environment, such as enabling a shorter work week or allowing workers to do the bulk of their work at a time that suits them best (56%). In addition, decision makers said they also consider how new AI allows staff to focus on higher level tasks (47%) and how it saves existing employees’ time (40%). The number of  existing jobs these technologies could replace is also considered by those surveyed (32%). Only 5% of respondents said that their company does not consider the effects of AI on their existing employees when acquiring or scaling AI in their organization. By taking existing employees into consideration, most business leaders appear to be thinking holistically about the impact AI has, and will continue to have, on their businesses as a whole.\nOf those who reported acquiring or scaling AI during the pandemic, 93% said it has created a need for workers with the technical skills required to manage AI or its outcomes. Just under a third (32%) of these respondents [5] said they have already begun hiring new people for the roles that AI has created during the pandemic and 36% have already upskilled or reskilled existing employees to get the technical skills they need to fill these roles. Meanwhile, 2 in 5 (40%) respondents noted that their organization intends to hire new people for these roles and 38% are planning to launch upskilling or reskilling programs for current employees in order to bridge their business’ AI skills gap. When assessing talent to reskill or upskill, an overwhelming number of respondents [6] said their organizations are most likely to select talent from their IT departments (63%), followed by finance (17%), HR (9%) and marketing and communications (7%).\nChetan Dube, founder and CEO of IPsoft, said: “At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses across the country—and around the world—turned to AI to strengthen their balance sheets, maintain and even enhance their customer service offerings. AI was a buoy for surviving in difficult circumstances. What this research shows is that, while AI has served as a stopgap and an aide during the pandemic, business leaders recognize that AI is here to stay and will play an even greater role in the workplaces of the future.”\nDube added: “Business leaders have also awakened to the realization that humans and technology are not at odds. The digital economy is speeding up. Organizations need to constantly consider how their people and technologies fit into their strategies, not every forty years but every four months.”\nMethodology\nIPsoft commissioned independent market research company Censuswide to conduct the research. A total of 250 C-suite individuals, vice presidents and business owners (aged 18+) were surveyed in August 2020 in the United States. The respondents were from organizations with at least 500 employees in any sector.\n[1] 71% of respondents whose organization acquired or scaled up AI technologies during the global COVID-19 pandemic noted that after acquiring or scaling AI technologies during the pandemic, their organization is very likely to bring back workers who were furloughed during the pandemic\n[2] Companies with 500+ employees\n[3] Statistic includes the percentage of respondents that did not select: \"I/my company do not consider the effect on our existing employees when we acquire or scale AI within our organization’\" \"unsure\" or \"none of the above\" when asked; \"Which of the following statements, if any, describe the effects on employees that you/your company consider when/if you were acquiring or scaling AI within your organization? (Tick all that apply)\"\n[4] Respondents whose organization acquired or scaled up AI technologies during the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has created a need for workers with the technical skills required to manage AI or its outcomes, such as data scientists or AI trainers and whose organization has already started hiring new people for these roles and/or intends to hire new people for these roles.\n[5] Respondents whose organization acquired or scaled up AI technologies during the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has created a need for workers with the technical skills required to manage AI or its outcomes, such as data scientists or AI trainers.\n[6] Respondents whose organization acquired or scaled up AI technologies during the global COVID-19 pandemic, which has created a need for workers with the technical skills required to manage AI or its outcomes, such as data scientists or AI trainers and whose organization intends to launch upskilling or reskilling programs to help their existing employees fill these roles or has already upskilled or reskilled existing employees to help existing employees fill these roles.\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

Through her Semantic Interface, Amelia can understand a user’s request such as, “I want to add Frequently Asked Questions,” and guide the user through the implementation of that skill for its Conversational AI agent.\nAdeel Fudda, Intelligent Automation Director at Mars, commented: “With the Amelia Digital Employee Builder, the ease of developing Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) has dramatically changed and you no longer need people with AI and IT expertise to deploy them.  Basically, you are giving every Business Analyst the ability to deploy and build experiences within IVA’s.”\nThe democratized approach to implementing Conversational AI agents will increase the velocity of use-case development, while driving greater adoption through a higher number and broader range of proof-of-concepts, accelerating the time-to-value of AI within the organization.\nChetan Dube, CEO and founder of Amelia, commented: “Over the past two decades, we’ve dedicated ourselves to creating Amelia, the most intelligent conversational agent on the market, who has repeatedly made a transformational impact on the organizations in which she is implemented. We believe in the power of Conversational AI to establish a truly hybrid workforce with human and digital employees working together to achieve amazing things – and the launch of the Digital Employee Builder is important in enabling us to open up these opportunities to organizations that don’t have the extensive AI expertise internally.”\nThe Digital Employee Builder provides a no-code solution for deploying the full capabilities of the Amelia platform, which has repeatedly been recognized as industry-leading by independent analyst firms, including Forrester, Everest Group and Ovum. The multi-tenant platform scales to address multiple scenarios, from internal conversational interactions around IT and HR, to external and sophisticated implementations replacing IVRs in contact centers.\nUnlike chatbots and more limited virtual assistants that react to keyword-driven instructions and follow static decision trees, Amelia´s cognitive brain allows users to have natural, human-like conversations to execute tasks or resolve queries. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), Amelia is also able to handle complex conversations and digressions, follow context switching, and independently execute complex tasks to resolve user requests. Her state-of-the-art affective computing and sentiment analysis enable her to recognize and adapt her responses based on the mood of the user and the context of the situation. These skills are constantly improving through her automated learning capabilities.\nAmelia's groundbreaking appearance allows for even more true-to-life communication and collaboration between humans and machines by delivering visual elements for interactions.\n\nFor more information on the Digital Employee Builder, please see here.\nFor more information on the Amelia Platform, please see here.\nTo learn how the Amelia Platform has driven transformational change at Telefonica Peru, please see here.\n\n*Smarter With Gartner, 2 Megatrends Dominate the Gartner Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence, 2020, September 2020, https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/2-megatrends-dominate-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2020/\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

{"Title": "Top US Law Firm Partners with Amelia to Optimize Customer Service, Signs 600 New Clients", "Date": "October 29, 2020 • 5 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nAmelia’s AI-Powered Technology Supports Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. Attorneys at Law, in Delivering Digital Employees with a Focus on Improving Efficiencies, Enhancing Customer Service and Giving Hours Back to Busy Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n• 12% of all leads have been generated by Amelia since January\n• 100% of all inbound calls from 25 different phone lines is handled by the digital employee\nNew York, October 27, 2020 – The state-of-the-art cognitive artificial intelligence (AI) from Amelia, has signed more than 600 new clients to the Atlanta-based personal injury law firm of Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. Attorneys at Law, since January 2020. The clients were signed with Amelia’s Digital Colleague of the same name, who has been scaled to handle 40,000 web visitors and 20,000 phone calls per month from start to finish.\nAmelia fills the role of a digital legal assistant to support clients of Nugent’s eight offices across Georgia and surrounding states. In a multi-phase partnership, the conversational 24/7 AI-powered assistant offloads administrative duties for hundreds of intake workers, case managers, paralegals and attorneys at the firm, further improving client experiences, minimizing delays and helping client managers build better cases. This new tool has already increased client satisfaction and improved brand ratings.\nKen Nugent, Founder and Attorney at Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. Attorneys at Law, commented: “Our drive to always provide our clients with the best experience in what can be a distressing time and process has meant that we constantly look at new ways technology can improve how we do business. By incorporating Amelia, our staff has more time to give customers the support they need. We have an emotional element of communication to all the people we represent. Amelia is massively alleviating the demands on our case workers by removing mundane and time-consuming tasks. It’s like giving a personal assistant to each of our case managers, so they can spend more time connecting with our clients and building winning cases.”\nAmelia has repeatedly been identified as industry-leading by independent analyst firms, including Forrester, Everest Group and Ovum, for her outstanding performance in conversational AI for complex use cases, as well as her unique ability to improve support, elevate customer service and generate new revenue. This is all customized to Ken Nugent’s business model, which supports multiple functions and will eventually be available to other law firms.\nUnlike a chatbot, Amelia recognizes intent, demonstrating a contextual understanding in her interactions with end users. Her cognitive abilities augment the experience of both customers and internal employees. Nugent’s new Digital Employee incorporates all of these capabilities to offer an enhanced and competitive customer service program.\nNugent continued: “We have been in business for over 30 years and we have never been faced with a challenge quite like the one presented by COVID-19. Amelia, our new digital employee, has helped us get through the pandemic with greater efficiency as our intake team and case managers work from home, and she has provided our team with a surprising amount of elasticity. With Amelia handling our phones, we are now prepared to upskill half of our receptionists to serve as case managers. That would never have been an option without Amelia coming onboard.”\nIncorporating advanced AI and Natural Language Understanding, Amelia’s cognitive brain is capable of recognizing switched contexts, user intent, emotional states and more. This allows her to have human-like conversations to execute tasks or resolve queries.\nBetter customer service to build a better case \nTo build the best possible case, the law firm's clients are asked to input their information into an electronic health journal on a daily basis to help case managers track injuries that may not show up immediately following an accident.  Some injuries develop over time. Amelia also assists clients with their inquiries via web chat, and supports Intake Specialists by collecting initial information from web visitors before routing them to the appropriate person.\nThe Digital Employee is also hosted on the personal injury firm’s phone service and website to answer inbound questions promptly and accurately. Amelia serves the site’s 40,000 monthly visitors and is the first point-of-contact for 100% of inbound calls from the firm’s 25 different phone lines. Amelia handles more than 20,000 calls per month, which represents 75% of all calls, from end-to-end. In addition, the law firm saves $10,000 monthly by layering Amelia into its after-hours phone system in lieu of an after-hours contracting answering service. Following the initial implementation, Amelia has been rolled out across the firm’s eight Georgia offices located in Albany, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Duluth, Macon, Savannah and Valdosta.\nAt Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. Attorneys at Law, Amelia assists her human colleagues with:\nCase Manager Assistance\nAmelia takes the pressure off of busy case managers by automatically replying to questions through a client portal. By alleviating case managers of simple, repetitive tasks, Amelia enables them to focus most of their time on building the best possible cases for their clients. Amelia was responsible for 111 of the cases the firm signed in September, and she has earned roughly $500,000 in new business that might not otherwise have been attained.\nCustomer Portal Support\nAmelia helps clients navigate through the customer portal and helps them keep this important record up to date to support their case. She also monitors the information that is inputted into the health record so that any significant updates can be escalated to the case manager to intervene as required. This improves the accuracy of patient records and gives precious time back to case managers to manage more complex tasks.\nCustomer Inquiry Agent via Phone\nAmelia has become the first point of contact for clients over the phone. She is able to identify a claim and automatically connect the client to the relevant member of the team handling the case. Amelia also helps clients log into the client portal, discusses the client's most recent doctor visits, shares legal team info and reminds clients of upcoming appointments. Best of all, everything is tied back into the law firm’s CRM system.\nGoing forward, Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. Attorneys at Law, plans to use Amelia to generate letters and email messages to concerned parties, further supporting the case management team. The firm also intends for Amelia to make outbound calls to clients, which will save an average of 60,000 to 75,000 hours per year in case management.\nChetan Dube, CEO and founder of Amelia, said: “Amelia's dedication to developing the most human-like and leading-edge cognitive capabilities enables us to deliver tangible business benefits and transform the user experience by understanding the user's intent and injecting emotion into the digital interaction, usually attributed to a face-to-face conversation.”\nConnect with Amelia\nFollow us on Twitter: @IPsoft and LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ameliaai\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/IPsoftAmelia\nRead about our customers’ successes: https://amelia.ai/customer-stories/\nAbout Kenneth S.

With its history of innovation firsts and the ability to address the digital transformation needs of the front and back office, Amelia has cemented its place as a leader in conversational AI. Amelia’s ease of use, powerful conversational intelligence, and ability to gauge customer intent have helped companies reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction.\nTo read more about Amelia's award, click here. \n\"As one of the most feature-rich and adaptable digital workers in the market, Amelia can be easily expanded with new capabilities, take on additional responsibilities, and be used as the ‘face’ of the business for external customers and employees. As a next-generation intelligent assistant, Amelia boasts a comprehensive array of capabilities to increase CSAT, lower costs, and differentiate the businesses employing it,\" said Nancy Jamison, Industry Director. \"Amelia understands customer sentiment and intent and can change the way she interacts based on conversation content and emotion. Amelia acknowledges that people change their minds or switch topics, and adapts to the change by handling the new context.\"\nWhen used in an agent support role, Amelia’s recommendation engine can analyze 50,000 conversations in less than one second and highlight to the agent the top five best responses based on semantic analysis. The model is then continuously retrained based on agent choices to keep it fresh, relevant, and useful. Its key features include sentiment understanding, context switching, integration with a multitude of back-end systems, automated learning and training, continuous learning and improvement, Net Promoter Score metrics, omnichannel interaction, and multilingual capabilities.\nAmelia was the first virtual agent in the market when launched in 2014 and the first enterprise conversational intelligence assistant designed to complete job functions. Subsequent versions added the ability to perform end-to-end IT service desk and HR functions; conversational problem solving with contextual awareness, observational learning, and intelligent process execution. By using the more advanced capabilities under the umbrella of AI, Amelia takes self-service to the next level and enables the large-scale deployment of virtual workers that improve both the customer experience and the bottom line for organizations.\n\"Leveraging its history in process automation, [Amelia] has also developed a formal RPA platform and launched [the Amelia HyperAutomation platform, formerly 1Desk], a cognitive platform that aids end-to-end process automation of an organization’s back-end system,\" noted Jamison. \"The company has extensive expertise in the core areas that helped build the Amelia engine, including linguists, speech scientists, developers, and programmers. This customer-centricity, along with a forward-looking strategy, is expected to keep Amelia ahead of the competition in the long term.\"\nEach year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in implementing strategies that proactively create value for its customers with a focus on improving the return on the investment that customers make in its services or products. The award recognizes the company's unique focus on augmenting the value that its customers receive, beyond simply good customer service, leading to improved customer retention and customer base expansion.\nNumerous case studies demonstrate the value that the Amelia platform provides. For instance, Telefónica, the leading telco in Peru, uses the Amelia platform to handle mobile and landline customer support, fielding 7 million calls a month. Within six months of installation, Telefónica had implemented 28 use cases for Amelia, with 91% intent recognition, enabling her to handle 20% of all customer support interactions.\nSimilarly, BBVA, which is the leading bank in Mexico, uses Amelia in its customer-facing mobile app. BBVA’s branded Amelia avatar, Blue, is designed to improve the customer experience (CX). Since its launch in December 2019, Blue has assisted 9.2 million users with 150,000 conversations a month, with 90% intent recognition and 62% end-to-end resolution.\nBankia, as the fourth-largest bank in Spain, sought to use Amelia as a way of digitally transforming its business and differentiating its customer service from the larger participants in the market. As such, Bankia embarked on three separate projects with three different partners in the area of employee support, contact center, and mobile app support for customers.

During the year, the Amelia® platform has been recognized by Forrester, Everest and Frost & Sullivan for the transformational impact of her advanced cognitive capabilities on the enterprise.\nThe Amelia platform also has been implemented by more than 100 new clients in 2020 across a diverse range of industry types and enterprise sizes. These include Alvarez & Marsal, Bankia, Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, Kenneth S. Nugent, P.C. Attorneys at Law, Securus Technologies, Sterling National Bank, TriStar Plastics Corporation and Unisys Corporation.\n2020 was a pivotal year for Amelia. In October, the launch of the Digital Employee Builder further supported Amelia’s mission of democratizing Conversational AI by significantly lowering the technical barriers to adoption. The platform leverages cognitive intelligence to simplify the process for designing, deploying and implementing Conversational AI agents. This increased accessibility empowers subject matter experts to act as Citizen Developers, enabling those without previous experience in intelligent automation to create novel implementations.\nIn February, Digital Workforce.ai™ launched as the first marketplace for Digital Employees™ that can collaborate with human colleagues and catalyze the creation of the hybrid workplace for businesses. Businesses cloud-source AI-powered digital workers through the marketplace, each one possessing decades of experience in enterprise AI for specific roles, skills and industries, and with advanced cognitive, self-learning and conversational capabilities.\nThe transformation of the Amelia product portfolio for improved access to Conversational AI builds on the two-decade long mission of founder and CEO, Chetan Dube, who said: “‘Can machines think?’ This question has wholly consumed my research and the development of Amelia over the past two decades. As her cognitive intelligence advances, I increasingly recognized that the next great hurdle would be in democratizing access to her growing capabilities. Over the coming years, the gap between those organizations that have the investment and technical capabilities to implement enterprise-grade AI, and the have-nots, will become a chasm and ultimately determine the future survival of these organizations.”\nUnlike chatbots and more limited virtual assistants that react to keyword-driven instructions and follow static decision trees, the cognitive brain of the Amelia platform allows users to have natural, human-like conversations to execute tasks or resolve queries.

For example, if Bianka doubts which contact to use, she will ask or display a list of the contacts most similar to the one indicated.\nBianka is available 365 days at any time, with direct communication in real time, and fast responses and resolutions.\nLuis de Mena, director of Bankia Mobile, explained that “Bianka is a tool that allows us to optimize the experience of our clients in their interaction with the bank. Thanks to Artificial Intelligence, customers can carry out regular banking operations through Bianka, which understands and responds by voice.”\nThe assistant is integrated into the Bankia app and any client can access it through the main menu. This tool is available on both the Android and iOS operating systems.\nBianka’s functionalities\nGema González, Director of Conversational Assistants at Bankia, highlights that “thanks to the functionalities available to Bianka, the client can consult the balance and movements of their accounts; know the most common news such as if the payroll has been entered; if it has received transfers or if receipts have been uploaded; carry out transfers between accounts or send money through Bizum (a money exchange system).” Bianka accomplishes all of this with Amelia, repeatedly chosen as an industry leader in Conversational AI by independent analyst firms including Everest Group, Forrester and Ovum.\nIn addition, new functionalities for Bianka include: card balance check, security code (CVV) and expiration date lookup, paid receipts and pending charges, account verification and validation (including IBAN for international accounts), manage receipts, notifications, digital signature requests or changes, or manage new accounts.\nEach interaction allows Bianka to understand and store knowledge and then apply that knowledge to solve similar situations, so that she constantly evolves and learns.\nIsabel Castro\n[email protected]\n699418463\nAbout Amelia\nAmelia is a leading Enterprise AI software company with a long history of innovation in automation and Conversational AI.

Hires Amelia to Enhance Customer Service", "Date": "April 16, 2021 • 2 minute read", "Contributor": "", "Content": "\nAmelia will provide company information, material data, recommendations and portal-based customer support.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW YORK, NY, April 16, 2021 — Amelia, the largest independent leader in enterprise Artificial Intelligence (AI), today announced that TriStar Plastics Corp., a leading engineered plastics manufacturing company, is deploying Amelia, the market-leading Digital Employee, to digitize the company, improve customer experience, and help employees focus on business development.\nRichard Cedrone, CEO of TriStar Plastics Corp., said: “In our pursuit of corporate digital transformation, Amelia will be one of our primary drivers to accomplish our long-range goals. Our phased approach will first introduce Amelia from a basic customer service agent and train her to be a material recommendation expert. Our end goal as the technology is enhanced is to have a virtual branch office with only Digital Employees — a dream that is closer than you think.”\nChetan Dube, CEO of Amelia, said: “We’re very excited to be working together with TriStar as they utilize Conversational AI and Amelia to enhance customer service and company operations. TriStar is a pioneer in the plastics manufacturing industry, and Amelia will only extend its tradition of innovation by taking on rote and repeatable tasks for TriStar engineers, allowing them to take their talents and skills to new heights.”\nTriStar wanted a way to enhance its processes for receiving and fulfilling customers’ material engineering requests. When customers are looking for the right material for their application, they interact with TriStar engineers who are primarily focused on gathering application data elements and making a material recommendation. TriStar was looking for a solution to help them enhance their customer experience and improve their one-touch resolution for engineering requests.\nTriStar turned to Amelia to support its customer portal and subsequently relieve employees from repetitive, time-consuming administrative tasks. TriStar hired Amelia to answer customer questions, offer material recommendations, provide quotes for material selections and send topic-specific flyers to customers. Eventually, TriStar also wants Amelia to check order statuses, pay bills and place orders.\nTriStar will deploy Amelia in phases. In the first phase, which will launch at the end of Q2 this year, Amelia will be placed in a customer-facing role to provide customer support and help generate leads. When Amelia engages in a conversation with a customer, she will first identify the contact or create an account in the company's CRM system for further follow-up and support.\nOnce an account is created or identified, Amelia will address the customer’s engineering requests and aid in their material selection. She will provide the customer with digital company brochures and material information and ask all pertinent application element questions. Once Amelia has gathered the necessary information, the data will run through an API to a PV calculator and materials database, which will produce material recommendations for Amelia to package and present to the customer.\nTriStar’s implementation of Amelia will help the company to digitize their operations and deliver superior customer experiences. Amelia will take on mundane, routine tasks so that TriStar’s engineers can focus on project support, and so that inside sales staff can contribute to business development. By implementing Amelia, TriStar will empower their employees to focus on higher-level tasks for continued company growth, while Amelia successfully and efficiently addresses TriStar customer requests.\nAbout TriStar Plastics Corp.\nTriStar Plastics Corp. provides engineering, custom fabrication and manufacturing of high-performance plastics and self-lubricating bearings materials. Our capabilities include component design, material selection, prototype, production and manufacturing.

Amelia’s conversational and multilingual capabilities enable Starfish Digital to interact with their clients personally in their native languages. As their client base grows and expands, Amelia’s HyperAutomation capabilities will facilitate Starfish Digital's growth without requiring linear growth of resources.\nStarfish is initially focused on the Southeast Asia market, where the combined population and potential market is more than 650 million people, with plans to expand globally. Thailand and Singapore are Starfish’s leading markets — where corporations have prioritized digitalization as a result of COVID-19. Starfish hired Amelia in anticipation of changes brought on by the pandemic that will likely lead to the rise of a new type of financial services provider in the region. These institutions will prioritize hyper-personalization, ecosystem plays, risk management, and a trend towards building connected platforms. Starfish will begin offering Amelia’s services to clients in August 2021.\nAbout Starfish Digital\nStarfish Digital is a microservice and digital integration company headquartered in Singapore.

It provides customers with answers to common questions, such as inquiries related to account balances, recent transactions and online banking issues. For routine requests, Skye shortens the time from inquiry to resolution, allowing users with more complex issues to speak with a Sterling customer service representative more quickly.\nSince launch, Skye has handled more than two million customer requests and now solves close to 50% of the most common requests received by Sterling’s Contact Center. Sterling plans to incorporate the Amelia technology into a solution that will further enhance the customer experience and increase the number of interactions Skye can support.\n“With the support of Amelia’s technology, we have been able to maintain the high level of service our customers have come to expect.

The provider already offers a broad range of digital services for local governments, and will also integrate Amelia’s market leading Conversational AI solution to provide round-the-clock assistance and humanise its citizen-facing services.\nThis implementation underpins how Centric is adapting to evolving citizen expectations and the increasing demand for high-quality, 24/7 services. Amelia, The Most Human AI™ will communicate to citizens seamlessly using Natural Language Processing, understand different languages and accents, and switch contexts between conversations. Instead of filling out long forms to process marriage or birth certificates in-person at a town hall, Amelia will support citizens in carrying out these requests online, via text or voice.\nBy digitising more services, Centric will increase service speed and efficiency whilst remaining customer-oriented. Citizens can choose when, how and where they want to complete applications and Amelia will keep them updated throughout the process. In addition, Amelia will remove some of the workload from local government workers so they can focus on higher level, strategic projects.\nDuring this deployment, Centric will collaborate with the government’s Common Ground chatbot initiative (GEM), to ensure the Amelia implementation is complementary to existing services. Alongside the GEM, Amelia will strengthen communication with citizens and elevate citizen service provision to an even higher level.\nFollowing the successful integration of Amelia in a select number of local government municipalities, Centric plans to expand the technology to all of its local government customers, serving approximately 10 million Dutch citizens. The first phase will be a soft launch in tandem with the digital service “Moving” (eDienst Verhuizen). The goal is for Amelia’s self-learning algorithms to enable municipalities to quickly and easily deploy Amelia as a pre-trained digital civil servant who works collaboratively with existing local government services.\nMaarten Hillenaar, CEO of Centric Public Sector Solutions said: “Our partnership with Amelia will enable local government organisations to better connect with citizens, through streamlined, automated communications, and boost citizen engagement throughout the country. In today’s digital world, citizens now expect the same level of service from their local authority as they do from their bank or online retailer. With Amelia, potentially millions of Dutch citizens will now have an unparalleled digital experience for public sector processes and applications.”\nChetan Dube, Founder & CEO of Amelia commented: “Compared to some others, the public sector is typically cautious to adopt new technologies, but there is huge untapped potential for government organisations to drive economic and societal benefits with Conversational AI. By partnering with Centric, our aim is to help the Netherlands become a world leader in digital public services and showcase the importance of AI in promoting citizen participation and engagement.”\nJeroen de Haas, General Manager, Netherlands, Amelia added: “By speeding up the process for important records such as marriage certificates and wills, and by making key government services more accessible, the digitisation of public services with Amelia is going to have a profound effect on people’s lives.

In her new role at Top Aesthetics, Amelia will be a digital healthcare agent for patients interested in cosmetic procedures, complementing and improving patient care and customer service by allowing staff to optimize the time spent with each patient.\nOn average, Top Aesthetics’ phone-based and online request volume reaches 200 requests per day. When the company launches marketing campaigns or special pricing, request volume often spikes to 1,000 daily requests. Top Aesthetics was interested in utilizing AI to improve patient experiences without saddling staff with answering repetitive FAQs, scheduling appointments and other time-consuming job functions.\nDr. Humberto Palladino, founder of Top Aesthetics, said the company decided to deploy Amelia, the market-leading Conversational AI agent, as it aligned with his philosophy of putting the most advanced resources at the service of patients. Amelia will answer questions 24/7, via phone or website chat, with services available in both English and Spanish. Amelia will also scale as demand increases, ensuring that Top Aesthetics is well-prepared for spikes in patient requests during promotions or other activities.\nBy hiring Amelia as its first point of contact, Top Aesthetics will give staff more time to focus on patients’ surgeries and after-care services, ultimately improving entire patient experiences from beginning to end.\nDr. Palladino said: \"I believe Amelia will provide a superior experience as it complements and allows to improve many tasks in different areas, freeing our company's staff to provide a better and more personalized service.\"\nChetan Dube, CEO of Amelia, said: “Top Aesthetics is hiring Amelia for jobs that perfectly suit her Conversational AI capabilities, and we’re excited to work with the company to provide enhanced patient experiences. Top Aesthetics will unbind its staff from mundane, repetitive tasks, allowing its employees to focus on providing safe, comfortable and supported cosmetic surgery journeys for its patients. It’s inspiring to watch Top Aesthetics commit to utilizing leading AI technology to deliver innovative and superior patient services.”\nAfter initial deployment, Top Aesthetics plans to extend Amelia’s responsibilities to include scheduling surgeries, collecting patient data and photos, and other tasks during the pre-consultation phase. The company also plans to train Amelia on pre-qualifying patients, and scheduling hotels (for traveling patients), surgical suites and surgical staff. Eventually, Amelia will be utilized to process online payments.\nAbout Top Aesthetics\nOur mission is to provide you with top-quality cosmetic surgery and service at an affordable price.
