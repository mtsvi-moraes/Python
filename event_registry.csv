(AP) -- Playing a bitter rival is nothing new for Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nFacing the Green Bay Packers with first place on the line Sunday at Soldier Field in one of the NFL\'s oldest rivalries has some similarities to the annual Michigan and Ohio State matchup, so Fields feels ready in this regard.\n\n"I mean, a rivalry game, it\'s big," Fields said. "I\'ve been in the position before. I wouldn\'t say it totally prepares me for this, but I have a pretty good idea of what a big rivalry game looks like."\n\nFields\' experience at Ohio State against Michigan comes from just one game his junior year, but it was a memorable one. He completed 14 of 25 for 302 yards and four touchdowns in a 56-27 Buckeyes\' win. The pandemic wiped out his chance to face Michigan again as a senior.\n\nHis best memories of it extended beyond just winning.\n\n"Trash talk before the game, in warmups, fans talking trash and stuff like that, I always enjoyed that," Fields said. "Hearing what they say, and the nonsense coming out of their mouths always gave me a good laugh before the game.\n\n"I mean, yeah, just the competition that goes with it. Just the excitement, and just the competition and stuff like that."\n\nThe excitement will be different this time because he\'s squaring off against Aaron Rodgers for the first time. The Packers have a 21-5 record against the Bears with Rodgers starting.\n\n"I\'m excited," Fields said. "Of course he\'s a Hall of Fame quarterback. He\'s a great quarterback. He\'s been playing since as long as I can remember.\n\n"I know it\'s gonna be a good matchup between him and our defense. Our defense has been playing well. I\'m excited to see him play."\n\nFields was 9 years old when Rodgers made his first NFL start in his third season in 2008 with Green Bay, and he has developed an appreciation for the Packers quarterback\'s playing style.\n\n"I just like how he\'s always in rhythm when he plays the game," Fields said. "That\'s a piece of his game that I try to emulate in mine."\n\nFields had an individual rivalry in college with Clemson\'s Trevor Lawrence but calls this different.\n\n"Of course me and Trevor faced off a couple times in college," Fields said. "To be honest, I don\'t look at it as a matchup between me and Aaron like I didn\'t look at it as a matchup back then between me and Trevor.\n\n"I\'m simply doing whatever I need to do to help my team win. If that\'s hand the ball off 80 times during a game or throw for however so many yards, that\'s what I\'m going to do. I\'m not worried about comparisons between touchdowns, stats. I\'m worried about winning. That\'s it."\n\nThe Bears no doubt would like to see Fields\' passing game emulate some of Rodgers\' success.\n\nAlthough they have gained some momentum with two straight wins, their rookie quarterback has been helped along by a revived defense that is now ranked eighth in the NFL, and a running game prospering even without injured running back David Montgomery.\n\nWhen Damien Williams and Khalil Herbert both had more than 15 carries against the Raiders in a 20-9 victory on Sunday, it marked the first time since 2010 the Bears had two backs make 15 or more carries in a game. The result was 143 rushing yards.\n\n"You have more of those 4, 5, 6, 7s (yards) than we\'ve had in the past where at times there\'s been 1s and 2s," Bears coach Matt Nagy said. "And so I think that helps out your second down, which can help out your third down. And that\'s just a total compliment to the players and the coaches for really creating that identity."\n\nFields has struggled with consistency, like most rookie passers. He has completed 51.4% (37 of 72) for 458 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. He has a 64.5 passer rating.\n\n"I think we have a good feel of who he is and how he\'s growing each week," Nagy said. "I think we feel good about that and how we can continue to help grow him."\n\nNOTES: Fields suffered knee and rib injuries in the game Sunday and left briefly before returning. He went through a full practice on Wednesday and was removed from the injury report. ... The Bears were without outside linebacker Khalil Mack (foot), wide receiver Allen Robinson (ankle) and defensive end Akiem Hicks (groin) at Wednesday\'s practice.\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nShare LINE Facebook Twitter Telegram WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Digg Email Print Previous articleFast start by Packers\' Adams has opponents feeling déjà vuNext articlePac-12 aiming to build on 2021 NCAA Tournament run 龔向華', 'source': {'uri': 'chinapost.nownews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The China Post, Taiwan'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://chinapost-media.nownews.com/2021/10/4a6760d2-preview.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-7172655', 'sentiment': 0.3333333333333333, 'wgt': 371865420, 'relevance': 2}

(AP) -- Green Bay Packers wide receiver Davante Adams says he occasionally is in the process of making a catch when he flashes back to a similar play he made months or years earlier.\n\nPackers opponents must be feeling a similar sense of déjà vu this season as Adams continues producing at a level that could earn him All-Pro honors for a second straight season.\n\nLast year, Adams became the first player in NFL history to have at least 100 receptions and 18 touchdown catches in the same season. Although he has only reached the end zone twice this year, Adams is on pace to exceed last year\'s totals in catches and yards receiving.\n\n"He\'s got people draped all over him and it doesn\'t matter," Packers coach Matt LaFleur said after Adams had a career-high 206 yards receiving Sunday in a 25-22 overtime victory at Cincinnati. "He finds a way to do it every time."\n\nAdams said after that game that he had told a few relatives beforehand he felt he might get a career high.\n\nHe also talked about how he sometimes catches a pass and subconsciously thinks back to plays he\'s made before. Adams referred to it as "some weird \'That\'s So Raven\' (stuff)", a reference to the Disney Channel sitcom from the early 2000s featuring a teenage girl with psychic abilities.\n\nAdams went into more detail about that Wednesday. He said it happens maybe a few times a year, usually on long-developing plays like deep patterns.\n\n"I\'ll be running, the ball will be in the air and I\'ll feel like I\'ve been in that moment before," Adams said. "It\'s basically déjà vu, like an active déjà vu, I guess you could say."\n\nSometimes the flashbacks aren\'t about catches he has made. They also can be about hits he\'s absorbed. He cited an example from his college career at Fresno State.\n\n"Literally in the air, as I was flipping, (I was) thinking about how that same thing happened before against Nevada," Adams said. "Same type of situation. I like it more when it happens on positive plays, but sometimes I\'ll have it when I\'m getting flipped in the air, too."\n\nAdams said he doesn\'t recall this ever happening to him during his childhood. The flashbacks occurred as he got older.\n\n"I think I had to kind of grow into that superpower," Adams quipped.\n\nThis season also has revealed one of Adams\' other talents: his ability to stay focused.\n\nAdams, who is in the final year of his contract, said at the start of training camp he wouldn\'t let any concerns about his future distract him this season. Adams noted how he managed to avoid worrying about the draft his final season at Fresno State and responded by catching 24 touchdown passes that year.\n\nHe has lived up to those words while helping the Packers (4-1) win four in a row.\n\nAdams heads into Sunday\'s game at Chicago (3-1) with 42 catches for 579 yards to lead the NFL in both categories. Adams had a franchise-record 115 catches for 1,374 yards and 18 touchdowns last season.\n\n"He\'s just so talented," quarterback Aaron Rodgers said after the Bengals game. "Even when you know that I\'m probably going to him, he still finds a way to get open and makes a big catch and breaks a tackle. The guy is a special player."\n\nAdams still sees room for improvement. He wants to boost those touchdown totals.\n\n"Every time I get an opportunity down there, whether I\'m doubled or singled up, I\'m going to try to come down with it," Adams said. "Make sure we make them count."\n\nFollow Steve Megargee at https://twitter.com/stevemegargee\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nShare LINE Facebook Twitter Telegram WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Digg Email Print Previous articleJackson\'s passing has rejuvenated Ravens\' offenseNext articleFields understands rivalries going into game against Packers 龔向華', 'source': {'uri': 'chinapost.nownews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The China Post, Taiwan'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://chinapost-media.nownews.com/2021/10/8e6bab61-preview.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-7179092', 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 371865420, 'relevance': 2}

(AP) -- When the Patriots have played well on defense in recent years, it usually has meant they\'ve gotten good play at linebacker.\n\nThat has been the case again this season with linebacker Matt Judon, one of their key offseason additions, thriving in his first year in New England\'s system.\n\nHe\'s leading the team with 6 1/2 sacks and has brought a gregarious personality to the locker room that has fit right in with a group that includes veterans such as Dont\'a Hightower, Kyle Van Noy and Jamie Collins, who was signed last week to begin his third stint with the team.\n\nIt has helped set the tone for a unit that enters the week ranked fifth in the NFL, allowing 317 yards and 18.4 points per game. The Patriots will need all of them to be at their best this week as they prepare to host a Dallas Cowboys offense that is ranked second in the NFL, averaging 439.6 yards per game.\n\nNew England will also be looking for a bit of redemption after giving up three touchdown passes and more than 300 yards passing to Houston rookie Davis Mills last week.\n\n"If we\'re gonna be a good football team, we\'re gonna have to prove it," Judon said. "Nobody\'s gonna give it to us."\n\nThe challenge against the Cowboys begins with trying to contain a quarterback in Dak Prescott who is dangerous both inside and outside the pocket, and is backed up by the dynamic running back duo of Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Pollard.\n\n"The skill players, you can damn near put them up against anybody up in the league as far as talent or production overall, however you want to look at it," Hightower said. "They\'re talented on each level or each tier of their offense."\n\nHightower, Van Noy and Collins all shared the field together in 2019, when the Patriots last beat the Cowboys 13-9 at Gillette Stadium. The trio led a group of linebackers which dubbed themselves "the boogeymen" as they combined for 19 sacks that season. They also ranked in the top four on the team in tackles.\n\nAfter barely having a chance to dive back into the Patriots\' playbook last week, Collins played just three snaps against the Texans but registered a sack.\n\nHe said there was an instant familiarity walking back into the Patriots locker room.\n\n"It\'s like going back home for the first time," Collins said. "I couldn\'t stop smiling. ... Just coming back in here and just knowing I can go out with these guys again for the third time. Three times, that\'s big."\n\nAfter opting out in 2020 because of COVID-19 concerns, on paper at least, Hightower is having one of the slowest starts to a season in his career. He has 19 tackles, but has yet to have a sack through the first five games. It\'s just the second time in his nine years in the NFL he has failed to have a sack by this point in the season.\n\nIf his production has slipped, Hightower hasn\'t noticed. And neither have his teammates.\n\n"I\'ve never been a numbers guy," Hightower said. "I\'m gonna do whatever I need to do for the team. Whether it\'s knock the (crap) out of lineman, if I\'m supposed to have eight or 10 tackles a game or have eight sacks -- that\'s what I plan on doing. I\'m just gonna do my job. I\'m a trash man. I just play football."\n\nThat dirty work has included everything from setting picks to free up other players to making well-timed stunt calls. The willingness to fill those roles have been beneficial, Judon said.\n\n"He does a lot of dirty jobs for us," Judon said of Hightower. "But he makes it look good."\n\nWhile Judon believes this defense is taking steps toward figuring out how to be consistent, he said their identity will change week to week as they try to adapt and keep opponents guessing.\n\nThat will mean taking advantage of all their opportunities this rest of the season, beginning Sunday against Dallas.\n\n"We\'ve got to change our style every week," Judon said. "But for us, our mentality, it stays the same. We want to play the upper end of football here and that never changes."\n\nNOTES: Running back Damien Harris (ribs), right guard Shaq Mason (abdomen) and cornerback Shaun Wade (concussion) all sat out Wednesday\'s practice.\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nShare LINE Facebook Twitter Telegram WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Digg Email Print Previous articlePac-12 aiming to build on 2021 NCAA Tournament run 龔向華', 'source': {'uri': 'chinapost.nownews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The China Post, Taiwan'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://chinapost-media.nownews.com/2021/10/600d85a3-preview.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-7178641', 'sentiment': 0.2392156862745098, 'wgt': 371865420, 'relevance': 2}

Pac-12 aiming to build on 2021 NCAA Tournament run October 14, 2021 Share LINE Facebook Twitter Telegram WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Digg Email Print\n\nThe Pac-12 had been an afterthought in the NCAA Tournament in recent years, the number of teams getting in dwindling, the deep runs into the bracket rare.\n\nThe conference took a big turn last season with three teams reaching the Elite Eight and UCLA playing in the Final Four, changing national perceptions while boosting confidence around the league.\n\nNow it\'s time to take that next step of consistently doing well in March.\n\n"I\'m really excited for the league with what we accomplished at the NCAA Tournament," Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley said Wednesday from Pac-12 media day in San Francisco. "It\'s what we\'ve been talking about in head coaches\' meetings for years. To have that success translate in the NCAA Tournament. Our conference, people are viewing us different because of that success. We have good momentum."\n\nThe Pac-12 was arguably the best conference in last year\'s tournament, going 13-5. UCLA, Southern California and Oregon State all reached the Elite Eight. The Bruins were seconds away from reaching the NCAA championship game, losing to Gonzaga on Jalen Suggs\' banked-in running 3-pointer at the buzzer.\n\nLed by preseason favorite UCLA, the conference is again loaded with talent headed into the 2021-22 season and the deep runs last spring have buoyed the confidence of teams across the league that they can do it, too.\n\n"It gave us a huge confidence boost, especially Oregon State and the ride they had, knowing we played them two really tough games," Washington State coach Kyle Smith said. "And just knowing, I thought the league was good and to get that national respect, we were working out in the spring with our chests kind of puffed out."\n\nALL PAC-12\n\nThe 2021-22 preseason all-Pac-12 first team is a big one.\n\nInstead of the usual five players on the first team, this year\'s team has 10 and five on the second team.\n\nUCLA leads the way with three players: Johnny Juzang, Tyger Campbell and Jaime Jacquez Jr. The first team also includes Oregon State\'s Warith Alatishe, Arizona State\'s Marcus Bagley, Colorado\'s Evan Battey, Arizona\'s Bennedict Mathurin, USC\'s Isaiah Mobley, Oregon\'s Will Richardson and Washington State\'s Noah Williams.\n\nBIGGER DUCKS\n\nOregon was forced to go with a small lineup for most of last season after 6-foot-11 forward N\'Faly Dante went down with a knee injury.\n\nThe Ducks will have more options this season with Dante expected to return and four players on the roster 6-11 or taller.\n\n"It gives up some flexibility where we go with some of our matchups that we didn\'t have a year ago," Oregon coach Dana Altman said. "As a coaching staff, you like being able to play different ways. You like being able to change it up if something\'s not working. Those guys give us the flexibility to do that."\n\nOREGON STATE EXPECTATIONS\n\nOregon State was picked to finish last in the Pac-12 in the preseason poll last year and went into the conference tournament as the No. 6 seed.\n\nThe Beavers became one of the surprises of March Madness, winning the Pac-12 Tournament then reaching their first Elite Eight since 1966 as a No. 12 seed.\n\nNow they enter the new season with added expectations.\n\n"The run we had last season, we can be satisfied," Oregon State guard Jarod Lucas said. "We can be happy about last season, it was a great season, but here we are a month away from a new season. We\'re going in with the same mindset, to win every game and get better in practice day in, day out."\n\nThe Beavers were picked to finish eighth in this year\'s preseason poll.\n\nBATTEY THE LEADER\n\nBattey has been a natural leader at Colorado, though he was able to share some of the load last season with a veteran-laden roster that included one of the best players in program history, point guard McKinley Wright IV.\n\nNow that Wright and others are gone, the senior big man becomes the unquestioned leader on a team filled with new players -- a role he\'s still feeling out.\n\n"Last year, we had a bunch of seniors where I didn\'t have to hold their hand so much, as I would say, through everyday practice," Battey said. "This year, I\'m really trying to bow the line of when to lead and when to let them figure it out for themselves, let them learn. I\'m trying to fight that urge, lead when I need to and let them grow."\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/College-basketball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nShare LINE Facebook Twitter Telegram WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Digg Email Print Previous articleFields understands rivalries going into game against PackersNext articleOld, new faces finding production at linebacker for Patriots 龔向華', 'source': {'uri': 'chinapost.nownews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The China Post, Taiwan'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://chinapost-media.nownews.com/2021/10/1c986d7f-preview.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-7175453', 'sentiment': 0.4901960784313726, 'wgt': 371865420, 'relevance': 2}

However, these standard features may not capture the full risk of recurrence for individuals with EBC.\n\nThe American Joint Committee on Cancer has identified the Ki-67 biomarker as Level of Evidence III in diagnosing EBC due to its association with cellular proliferation. Ki-67 is thus an important component of comprehensive risk assessment, but it has been inconsistently applied in the past.1\n\n"Agilent\'s Ki-67 IHC MIB-1 pharmDx (Dako Omnis) companion diagnostic assay for the Dako Omnis advanced staining platform has been designed and tested to aid in evaluating risk of recurrence in early breast cancer (EBC)," said Sam Raha, president of Agilent\'s Diagnostics and Genomics Group. "Its approval establishes a clinically relevant standard for recurrence risk assessment in EBC so that more high-risk patients who may experience clinical benefit from treatment with Verzenio are identified."\n\nThis approval builds on Agilent\'s previous successes in expanding the clinical applicability of therapeutic biomarker analysis, further cementing the company\'s position as a provider of diagnostic assays that deliver high quality and ease of implementation.\n\nAbout Agilent Technologies\n\nAgilent is a leader in life sciences, diagnostics, and applied chemical markets, delivering innovative technology solutions that provide trusted answers to researchers\' most challenging scientific questions.

Greg Gianforte issued a statement urging Montanans to get vaccinated, but added that "we will not mandate them."\n\nMeanwhile, the school district in Livingston, Montana, shifted its middle and high school classes to remote learning to slow the spread of the coronavirus among students. Officials said few students have used masks.\n\nThe school board voted Tuesday to have remote learning for its 740 middle and high school students until Oct. 25, because there are 17 coronavirus cases each at Park High School and Sleeping Giant Middle School.\n\nMORE ON THE PANDEMIC:\n\n-- U.S. border residents rejoice in lifting of travel ban\n\n-- FDA grapples with timing of booster for J&J COVID-19 vaccine\n\n-- Russia, WHO differ on when approval will come for Sputnik V\n\n-- Families of COVID-19 patients ask hospitals to rethink visitor policies\n\nSee all of AP\'s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic\n\nHERE\'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:\n\nHONOLULU -- Organizers are planning for the Honolulu Marathon even though it\'s not clear government officials will allow it to be held in December.\n\nHawaii Public Radio reports marathon organizers are frustrated that Honolulu is easing pandemic-related restrictions on large events but neither Hawaii\'s governor nor Honolulu\'s mayor have provided clarity about whether the marathon can happen with the thousands of participants it normally draws.\n\nIn 2019, there were more than 33,000 runners in the Honolulu Marathon, including more than 16,000 from Japan.\n\nOther large marathons in Boston and Chicago were held recently.\n\nSAN DIEGO -- Beleaguered business owners and families separated by a nonessential travel ban are celebrating after the Biden administration says it will reopen U.S. land borders next month.\n\nTravel across land borders from Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to workers whose jobs are deemed essential. New rules will allow fully vaccinated foreign nationals to enter the U.S. regardless of the reason starting in early November.\n\nUnlike air travel, for which proof of a negative COVID-19 test is required before boarding a flight to enter the U.S., no testing will be required to enter the U.S. by land or sea, provided the travelers meet the vaccination requirement.\n\nThe 19-month coronavirus restrictions had economic, social and cultural impact, preventing shopping and cross-border family gatherings when relatives live on different sides of the border.\n\nIn Del Rio, Texas, Mexican visitors account for about 65% of retail sales, said Blanca Larson, executive director of the chamber of commerce and visitors bureau in the city of 35,000 people. "Along the border, we\'re like more of one community than two different communities," she said.\n\nFully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents have been allowed into Canada since August, provided they have waited at least two weeks since getting their second vaccine dose and can show proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. Mexico has not enforced coronavirus entry procedures for land travelers.\n\nPORTLAND, Maine -- A federal judge declined Wednesday to intervene to stop Democratic Gov. Janet Mills\' requirement that health care workers be vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the month.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Jon Levy says none of the nine plaintiffs met the legal threshold for an injunction to halt the requirement to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 29 or lose their jobs.\n\nLevy ruled the record indicates regular testing alone is not sufficient to stop the spread of the delta variant.\n\n"The speed of the delta variant\'s transmission outpaces test-result availability," he wrote. Daily testing, he wrote, would require use of rapid tests that are both less accurate and in short supply.\n\nThe judge concluded the plaintiffs were unable to show an injunction was in the public interest or that they had a strong likelihood of prevailing if the lawsuit moves forward. The Liberty Counsel, which filed the lawsuit in August, vowed to appeal.\n\nBUCHAREST, Romania -- Doctors in Bucharest issued an open letter titled "a cry of despair" as the country\'s overwhelmed health care system copes with record cases, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nThe College of Physicians of Bucharest wrote a letter addressed to Romanians that says the medical system has "reached the limit."\n\nOn Wednesday, Romania confirmed 15,733 new infections and 390 deaths, bringing the total number of deaths to 40,461. Data from health authorities indicate that more than 90% of coronavirus patients who died last week were unvaccinated.\n\nHungary has agreed to provide care to several dozen COVID-19 patients from Romania in the coming days to help ease the burden on hospitals.\n\nDragos Zaharia, a primary care doctor at Bucharest\'s Marius Nasta Institute of Pneumology, thinks Romanian authorities should have enlisted a "famous personality" to lead the country\'s vaccination campaign.\n\n"Only anonymous guys are leading this fight," Zaharia told The Associated Press. "It\'s heartbreaking for us when we know that a lot of those who died could have lived, if they would have been vaccinated."\n\nBOSTON -- More than 800 people who work for Boston have been suspended without pay for failing to comply with the city\'s coronavirus vaccine mandate.\n\nActing Mayor Kim Janey announced in August the city\'s roughly 18,000 employees would be required to either show proof of vaccination or submit to regular testing.\n\nJaney says the suspended employees who didn\'t meet Tuesday\'s initial deadline came from five "public facing" agencies, including the public schools department, libraries, the center for youth and families, the disability commission and the age commission. Workers who continue to ignore the mandate face termination, she said. The school department alone has about 11,000 employees.\n\nThe city is making plans to deal with potential staffing shortfalls, which so far accounts for less than 1% of workers. Suspended employees can return to work by providing proof of a negative test.\n\nGENEVA -- The World Health Organization says the number of global coronavirus cases fell in the last week, continuing a downward trend that began in late August.\n\nIn its latest weekly assessment of the pandemic published on Wednesday, the U.N. health agency says there were about 2.8 million new cases and 46,000 confirmed deaths in the last week, a drop of 7% and 10% respectively. Europe reported a 7% rise in cases, while all other world regions reported a decrease.\n\nWHO says Europe also had the biggest rise in deaths in the previous week, with 11% more COVID-19 deaths. WHO says the highest numbers of new cases in Europe were reported in Britain, Turkey and Russia.\n\nThe biggest drops in cases came in Africa and the Western Pacific, where case numbers fell by 32% and 27%, respectively. Deaths in both regions fell by more than a third.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration is wrestling with how to decide on booster doses of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOther manufacturers want to offer boosters six months after primary vaccination. But J&J proposed a range of times, from two months to six months. In a review posted Wednesday, FDA scientists didn\'t reach a firm conclusion, citing shortcomings with J&J\'s data.\n\nOn Thursday and Friday, an FDA advisory panel will recommend whether to back boosters of both the J&J and Moderna vaccines. An extra dose of Pfizer\'s vaccine already is available to certain Americans.\n\nPfizer and Moderna have provided the majority of U.S. COVID-19 vaccines. More than 170 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with those two-dose shots while less than 15 million Americans got the J&J shot.\n\nMOSCOW -- The head of the Russian sovereign fund bankrolling the shot says Russia is ready to provide up to 300 million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine to the U.N.-backed COVAX initiative.\n\nThat\'s despite the lack of WHO approval and Sputnik V vaccine production issues that are drawing concerns worldwide. Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev and the World Health Organization had vastly different takes Wednesday on when the Russian vaccine would get WHO\'s stamp of approval.\n\nSputnik V is already being used in 70 countries around the world despite not yet authorized by the U.N. health agency. Some officials in countries, especially in Latin America, have expressed concerns they aren\'t getting the vaccine\'s second shot in time to properly innoculate their people.\n\nMIAMI -- Families of COVID-19 patients are asking hospitals to rethink visitor policies a year and a half into the pandemic, which has killed 716,000 people in the U.S.\n\nThe relatives say they\'re being denied the right to be with loved ones at a crucial time. Doctors also are increasingly telling hospitals to relax restrictions to allow patients to see their families.\n\nHospitals in at least a half-dozen states have loosened restrictions governing visits to COVID patients. Others, however, are standing firm, backed by studies and industry groups that indicate such policies have been crucial to keeping hospital-acquired infections low.\n\nThe University of Utah Health this year announced its hospitals would allow up to two adult visitors for the entire hospital stay with protective equipment and recently vaccinated or recovered from the virus. Many hospitals have made exceptions only for coronavirus patients who are about to die.\n\nMOSCOW -- Russia has reported a record 984 daily coronavirus deaths amid a slow vaccination rate.\n\nIt\'s marked several record daily death tolls in the past few weeks. Infections have soared to near all-time highs, with 28,717 confirmed cases reported Wednesday.\n\nThe Kremlin has attributed the mounting contagion and deaths to slow vaccinations. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said Tuesday about 29% of the country\'s nearly 146 million people were fully vaccinated.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin emphasized the need to speed up the vaccination rate on Tuesday, but he also has cautioned against forcing people to get the shots. Health experts have attributed the slow pace of vaccination to widespread vaccine skepticism and disinformation.\n\nThe Kremlin has ruled out a new nationwide lockdown similar to the one during the first months of the pandemic that badly crippled the economy and dented Putin\'s ratings. It has delegated the power to enforce coronavirus restrictions to regional authorities.\n\nThe increased infections have increased the pressure on Russia\'s health care system. Speaking at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said 11% of Russia\'s 235,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients are in serious or critical condition.\n\nRussia\'s coronavirus task force has confirmed more than 7.8 million cases and 219,329 deaths -- the highest death toll in Europe. Russia trails the U.S (718,000), Brazil (601,000) India (451,000) and Mexico (283,000) in confirmed global deaths.\n\nGENEVA -- The World Health Organization released a proposed list of 25 experts to advise it on the next steps in searching for the origins of the coronavirus after its earlier efforts were slammed for accommodating China, where the first human cases were detected in late 2019.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the U.N. health agency says its proposed experts -- including some who were on the original team that went to Wuhan to probe the origins of COVID-19 -- would be subject to a two-week public consultation period. Among the suggested members of the new team are Marion Koopmans of the Netherlands and Thea Fischer of Denmark, who were on the WHO team that visited China in February. In a recent commentary, Koopmans, Fischer and others said the search for the origins of COVID-19 had "stalled" and Chinese officials were still refusing to hand over some raw data.\n\nAfter the WHO-led team completed its China visit, the experts released a report concluding the possibility the coronavirus leaked from a Wuhan lab was "extremely unlikely," prompting criticism from outside scientists that the theory had not been properly vetted. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus later acknowledged it had been "premature" to dismiss the lab theory.\n\nNumerous health experts and scientists have called for an independent investigation to be conducted beyond WHO, pointing out the agency has no authority to compel countries, including China, to cooperate. China has said it welcomes further investigations of the coronavirus\' origins, but in other countries. A recent review of U.S. intelligence ordered by President Joe Biden found inconclusive evidence whether the coronavirus originated in a laboratory.\n\nTAGScoronaviruscoronavirus pandemicCovid-19pandemic Share LINE Facebook Twitter Telegram WhatsApp Linkedin ReddIt Digg Email Print Previous articleFrom cars to gasoline, surging prices match a 13-year highNext articleLawyer who aided Trump subpoenaed by Jan. 6 committee 龔向華', 'source': {'uri': 'chinapost.nownews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The China Post, Taiwan'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://chinapost-media.nownews.com/2021/10/0fdc968f-preview.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-7178392', 'sentiment': 0.09019607843137245, 'wgt': 371865240, 'relevance': 2}

At least three of the people who were involved in organizing and running the rally that preceded the violent riot have handed over documents in response to subpoenas from the committee.\n\nThe demands for documents and testimony from Clark reflect the committee\'s efforts to probe not only the deadly insurrection but also the tumult that roiled the Justice Department in the weeks leading up to it as Trump and his allies leaned on government lawyers to advance his baseless claims that the election results were fraudulent. Trump loyalists stormed the Capitol in an effort to disrupt the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden\'s victory\n\nClark, an assistant attorney general in the Trump administration, has emerged as a pivotal character in that saga. A Senate committee report issued last week shows how he championed Trump\'s efforts to undo the election results inside the Justice Department and clashed as a result with superiors who resisted the pressure, culminating in a dramatic White House meeting at which Trump floated the idea of elevating Clark to attorney general.\n\n"The Select Committee\'s investigation has revealed credible evidence that you attempted to involve the Department of Justice in efforts to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power," the chairman of the committee, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, wrote in a letter to Clark announcing the subpoena.\n\nWhile Trump ultimately did not appoint Clark acting attorney general, Clark\'s "efforts risked involving the Department of Justice in actions that lacked evidentiary foundation and threatened to subvert the rule of law," Thompson added.\n\nThe committee has scheduled a deposition for Oct. 29 and demanded documents by the same date. A lawyer for Clark declined to comment.\n\nThe Jan. 6 panel has so far sought testimony from a broad cast of witnesses, but its demands of Trump aides and associates are potentially complicated by Trump\'s vow to fight their cooperation on grounds of executive privilege.\n\nAlready one witness, Steve Bannon, has told the committee that he will not cooperate based on Trump\'s directive, though the committee has said it was "engaging" with two other Trump officials -- former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Defense Department official Kashyap Patel. It is also unclear whether Dan Scavino, Trump\'s longtime social media director and one of his most loyal aides, will cooperate.\n\nBiden formally rejected Trump\'s claim of executive privilege surrounding a tranche of documents requested from the former president\'s time in the White House, and set up their potential release to Congress in mid-November. White House counsel Dana Remus wrote to the National Archives in a letter released Wednesday that Biden believes that "an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States."\n\nOthers, though, are cooperating, including some of the 11 who organized or staffed the Trump rally that preceded the riot. They were given a Wednesday deadline to turn over documents and records, and have also been asked to appear at separate depositions the committee has scheduled beginning this month.\n\nAmong those responding to the Wednesday deadline was Lyndon Brentnall, whose firm was hired to provide event security that day. "All the documents and communications requested by the subpoena were handed in," he told The Associated Press.\n\nBrentnall had previously said his firm had "every intention" of complying with the select committee. "As far as we\'re concerned, we ran security at a legally permitted event run in conjunction with the U.S. Secret Service and the Park Police," he said.\n\nTwo longtime Trump campaign and White House staffers, Megan Powers and Hannah Salem, who were listed on the Jan 6. rally permit as "operations manager for scheduling and guidance" and "operations manager for logistics and communications," have also provided documents or are planning to do so.\n\nPowers, who served as the Trump reelection campaign\'s director of operations, intends to provide the requested documentation and to meet with the committee -- though it remains unclear what form such meetings will take, according to a person familiar with her response who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nMany of the rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 marched up the National Mall after attending at least part of Trump\'s rally, where he had repeated his meritless claims of election fraud and implored the crowd to "fight like hell."\n\nThe results of the election were confirmed by state officials and upheld by the courts. Trump\'s own attorney general, William Barr, had said the Justice Department found no evidence of widespread fraud that could have overturned the results.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the others who were subpoenaed intend to cooperate. A committee spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on the responses it had received and how many of the 11 were complying.\n\nMembers of the committee, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the panel\'s Republican vice chairwoman, have threatened to pursue criminal contempt charges against subpoenaed witnesses who refuse to comply. A House vote would send those charges to the Department of Justice, which would then decide whether to prosecute.\n\nThe subpoena to Clark follows the release of a Senate Judiciary Committee report that documented extraordinary tensions within the senior ranks of the Justice Department in December and January as Trump and his allies prodded the law enforcement agency to help him in undoing the election.\n\nThe report from the committee\'s Democratic majority depicts Clark as a relentless advocate inside the building for Trump\'s efforts, even presenting colleagues with a draft letter pushing Georgia officials to convene a special legislative session on the election results. Clark wanted the letter sent, but superiors at the Justice Department refused.\n\n"We need to understand Mr. Clark\'s role in these efforts at the Justice Department and learn who was involved across the administration," Thompson wrote.\n\nTwo additional organizers, Ali Alexander and Nathan Martin, as well as their "Stop the Steal" organization, were also subpoenaed for documents, which are due Oct. 21.\n\nAlexander wrote in a Telegram post Monday that the committee was "subpoenaing people in bad faith."\n\n"So maybe this Select Committee is bogus?" he added. "Everyone is waiting to see what I\'ll do."\n\n__\n\nColvin reported from New York and Smith from Providence, Rhode Island.
